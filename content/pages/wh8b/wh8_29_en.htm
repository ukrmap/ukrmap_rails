They were looking for vacant land suitable for cultivation.North America has become exactly what the British sought. Local climateresembled the European one, there were rich land and forests. Mississippi River Pools andSt. Lawrence gave to large vessels to reach areas of the continent,distant from the coast to 1000 km. In addition, there was not much strangernative population, as in the Spanish colonies. British had to meetfew (200 thousand persons) tribes whose main occupation was hunting.Therefore, English colonists with their jobs and not robbery, as didSpaniards settled the natural riches of the new continent.</span></p>
