In this section you are familiar withmost typical of the Orient, which actually determined, and furtherdefine its image. In deals with the period scholars distinguish three mainOrient: <b style="">Middle Eastern-Muslim</b>,

State structure is headed by the governor, the powerwhich was given him by God and consecrated by religion. This phenomenon has defined almost allfeatures civilizations East. This state did not have internal contradictions thatresulted in its stability. The only counterbalance to the state-owner could beonly private property, but it completely obeyed the state.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">PenetrationEast Europeans after the great geographical discoveries and the beginning ofColonial empires have become external invasion of private property, whichdestroying the relations that have traditionally formed.

Recognizing the powerstate apparatus, the producers (farmers community) paid in various forms (vidrobitok,of the crop) excess product. This kind of tax is then distributedto maintain power structures. Thus, one who had authority in the state, hadaccess to the distribution of manufactured products. Received, he became the owner.Therefore we say that the feature was the presence of eastern civilization governmentowner.</span></p>
