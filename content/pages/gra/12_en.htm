Tomb-Mechetnia, 367 m). The relief is complicated by the domes, mane, locks and man-made forms - waste banks, quarries, mounds. The region is rich in coal: coke, dovhopolumenyste, gas (part of the Donetsk coal basin). There are deposits of natural gas, construction materials: marl, chalk, flux limestone, sandstone, clay. Open mineral springs. The climate is continental with dry hot summers (21 째, 22 째 in July) and winter cold (-7 째, -8 째 in January). Precipitation 400-500 mm year, 70% of rainfall in the warm season.
