North of the region - spurs Serednoruskoyi Hills. From west to south Poltava plain changes in the Dnieper Lowland, and further to the southeast - in Donetsk height. The region is rich in fuel resources: natural gas and oil (oil-Dnieper-Donetsk region), coal. There are rock salt, phosphorites, ocher, nonmetallic raw materials for metallurgy (refractory clay, molding sand) and raw materials for construction materials (clay, sand, chalk, limestone and sand to produce unique optical glass, etc.). There are mineral springs. The climate is continental with relatively mild winters (-6,6 째, -8 째 in January) and warm dry summers (19,5 째, 21,5 째 in July). Precipitation 495-570 mm per year.

There are pine, oak-pine and flood forests and areas with stagnant roslynnisty. The wildlife includes 330 species, including: mammals - 61, amphibians - 11 birds - 211. Adverse natural processes: intense plane wash on steep slopes - landslides, wind and water erosion linear, salinization, waterlogging and silting of reservoirs. Reclamation: flow regulation, erosion and lisomelioratyvni measures. In the region 191 territories and objects protected areas, including state value: 3 sanctuaries, botanical garden, zoological park, the Arboretum, four park monuments of landscape architecture, 2 regional landscape parks, six natural reserves .</p><p class="rvps2"> <b> </b></p><p class="rvps2"> <b> </b></p><h2> Background </h2><p class="rvps2"> Kharkiv land lies on the edge of the forest-steppe and steppe zones. It influenced the whole early history. At the time of Herodotus&#39; Scythians lived here-farmers. In the Middle Ages in the valley of the Seversky Donets ruled nomads.
