Archaeological finds confirm the appearance of there creatures called Australopithecus, more than 5 million years ago. Australopithecus believe monkeys, which were on the verge of humanization, because they had features that zblyzhuvaly of their man: pryamohodinnya; greater than in monkeys, the average volume of the brain, significantly higher than in monkeys, the ratio of brain weight to total body weight; strong opposition of thumb to others and so on. The remains were found at the earliest Australopithecus oz.Turkana in Kenya, his age 5,5-5,0 million years. Last Australopithecus have age 850 thousand years. </li><li> oldest man scientists believe prezyndzhantropa or habilisa homo - man could that occurred within 3 million years ago and disappeared 1.1 million years ago. The people prezyndzhantropa counted on the basis of the first signs of labor, typical of him, because along with the bones of living creatures were discovered and artificial tools. </Li><li><img src="/images/uh7a/Thumbnails/01_01.jpg" align="right" border="1">
 Next step anthropo associated with the appearance or Nomo Pithecanthropus erectus - a person with direct pace. According to scientists, Pithecanthropus were 1,5-1,0 million years ago. Findings of their very numerous and found in different parts of the world. Pithecanthropus were 150-180 cm tall, the average brain volume was greater than that of Australopithecus. Their hands were more skilful, as evidenced by the more advanced and diverse tool partsi. They settled in caves or did some primitive housing on their own.

Even more close to humans in the modern sense of Neanderthals. The oldest finds date back to their period of 150-100 thousand years ago. As for human beings, Neanderthal was slightly lower than the growth of modern man, but distinguished hardihood. The volume of brain volume reached the brain of modern man, but retained many archaic features: development nadbrivnyh arcs and back of the combined low sloping forehead. This testified to the underdevelopment of a share of the frontal brain responsible for complex thinking, and the city center brake process. So, as suggest that Neanderthals were incapable of abstract thinking, their distinctive features - irritability and aggressiveness. Neanderthals and complexity of the problem is that the last of them survived to modern times of human physical type. </Li><li><img src="/images/uh7a/Thumbnails/01_03.jpg" align="right" border="1" width="86">
