</p><p class="rvps2"></p><h2> Restructuring and Ukraine </h2><p class="rvps2"> K. After the death of Chernenko in March 1985 as Secretary General of the CPSU Central Committee was elected Gorbachev. It was by his initiative in April 1985 began restructuring in the USSR. Surgery had to cover five major areas of society: the economy (transition from extensive to intensive management practices), domestic politics (democratization of public life and democracy), foreign policy (termination of the Cold War and building a common European house) social services ( improve material and cultural welfare) ideology (the elimination of censorship, openness, free expression of opinions of citizens). Theoretically the idea of restructuring had a chance to implement, but as life has shown, besides the general declarations, Gorbachev has failed for six-year period to put forward any practical conception of reforming Soviet society.</p><p class="rvps2"> Rebuilding quickly stalled, exacerbated the socio-political, economic and national crisis and the collapse of the Soviet Union ended. Ukraine caucus in words unequivocally supported the actions of the Kremlin leadership is actually a time blocked the restructuring processes in Ukraine.</p><p class="rvps2"> Perestroika had four stages. In March 1985 - January 1987 - reconstruction is carried out under the slogan &quot;more socialism.&quot; Between 1987 and 1988 - the main idea - &quot;more democracy&quot;, and 1989 - 1990 were characterized by separation and division in the camp leaders of perestroika, which led in 1991 to win radical reformism and the collapse of the USSR.</p><p class="rvps2"> the restructuring processes in Ukraine controlled totalitarian state administrative nomenclature. During 1985 - 1987 Famine in Ukraine there were no political forces in the form of NGOs and people&#39;s fronts, similar to those encountered in the Baltic States and Russia. The passivity of the masses has its explanation. Against the background of a general, primarily economic, the collapse of the situation in Ukraine has remained relatively stable.</p><p class="rvps2"> was another important subjective factor. Publicity in the national republics began to criticize party leaders first and nomenclature of different classes. V. Shcherbytsky that seventeen years led the Communist Party of Ukraine remained orthodox Communist and become one of the opponents of Gorbachev. Press Ukraine was called the Reserve stagnation.</p><p class="rvps2"> Chernobyl disaster (April 1986) helped revive the social and political movement in the republic. November 13, 1988 in Kiev, the first years of Soviet power by massive environmental rally (20 thousand participants). Besides environmental issues, have been subjected to sharp criticism of officials guilty of the Chernobyl disaster and its aftermath.</p><p class="rvps2"> 1989 Ukraine wave of mining strikes that close to the sharp economic requirements and political issues raised - giving confidence in the nomenclature and bureaucrats-bureaucrats.</p><p class="rvps2"> In a sharp escalation of social and economic crisis, rising prices and the relentless deterioration of living standards in the spring of 1990 were held the first democratic parliamentary elections, which reinforced the separation of political forces.</p><p class="rvps2"> In September 1989 there was a mass political organization - Movement (People&#39;s Movement of Ukraine for Perestroika). One by one created by political parties in Ukraine (Ukrainian Republican Party, Democratic Party of Ukraine, &quot;Green Party&quot;, Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, etc.).. July 16, 1990 the USSR Supreme Council adopted the Declaration on State Sovereignty of Ukraine, which became a harbinger of our country&#39;s independence.<img border=0 width=22 height=22 alt="" hspace=1 vspace=1 src="/images/uh11a/11_11.files/img3.jpg">

Restructuring initiative belonged to a small group of senior Communist party figures, who united around the new Central Committee Secretary Gorbachev. Today, when Gorbachev&#39;s political career was over, we can conclude that the reformers from the beginning, not his task to put the destruction of the totalitarian regime. Conceived reforms were not clearly defined. They spoke about the &quot;acceleration&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, a return to &quot;Leninist principles,&quot; the new face of socialism &quot;, etc.</p><p class="rvps2"> Rebuilding began with information. It appeared purely Soviet term &quot;publicity&quot;, which entered the foreign language without translation. In the transition from totalitarianism to democracy, transparency means a kind of transitional stage between the long period of quiet of mind to freedom of speech. Publicity - the right to know what happens in the country and the world.</p><p class="rvps2"> In the second half of 1980 - early 1990&#39;s in the state where all the information structure was under stringent control, such an interim step towards freedom of speech, as publicity was particularly necessary. Thanks to the publicity people overcome stereotypes and dogmas of the old thinking, got to really evaluate the situation, using objective information, make your own conclusions. Society is rapidly polityzuvalosya.</p><p class="rvps2"> pioneering role in the protection of Ukrainian culture, the environment, &quot;white spots&quot; of history played a Writers&#39; Union of Ukraine and its central body - the newspaper &quot;Literary Ukraine&quot;.

The most publicized policy response came in. In June and July 1988, there have been several unauthorized and unprecedented in scale rallies, which was led by former dissidents V. Chornovil Horyn brothers, Igor and Irina Kalynets. At these meetings openly talked about the many oppressions affecting Ukrainian.</p><p class="rvps2"> In June 1986, Ukrainian writers, including O. Gonchar, D. Pavlychko, I. Drach, opposed the exclusion of use in the schools of the republic Ukrainian. According to Education Minister V. Fomenko, in Ukraine in 1987 in Russian language schools enrolled more than half of all students, and in Kiev with 300 thousand students studying in Ukrainian only 70 thousand However, these statistics are worrying of those party functionaries. The party apparatus of Ukraine did not hurry to change national policy.<img border=0 width=22 height=22 alt="" hspace=1 vspace=1 src="/images/uh11a/11_11.files/img4.jpg">

In the &quot;top&quot; shaped reformist forces that have united around a new Central Committee General Secretary Gorbachev, elected to this position in March 1985</p><p class="rvps2"> In 1986, XXVII Party Congress defined the rate of &quot;acceleration&quot; - bridging the gap between the USSR from advanced countries. At the January plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in 1987 Gorbachev declared course of reconstruction, ie, improvement, upgrading of the Soviet system, and transparency. Ukraine was among the last who indulge in these processes.</p><p class="rvps2"> Since economic reform nashtovhnulosya of resistance inside of the CPSU, Gorbachev took a course on liberalization of the regime. He tried using the &quot;transparency&quot;, &quot;socialist pluralism&quot; under the slogan of &quot;restructuring&quot; the Stalinist model of socialism and a return to &quot;Leninist principles&quot; and activate the masses by controlling this activity again, loosen the reactionaries.</p><p class="rvps2"> In Ukraine, the political situation changed very slowly as the republic&#39;s leaders held a conservative position. In the first years of perestroika glasnost, declared in Moscow, had changed the face of the Republican press.</p><p class="rvps2"> in a liberalized environment in Ukraine there are groups of the Greens, political clubs, educational organizations ukrainovedcheskie (Lion Society &quot;1987 Club Heritage 1988 and the student union&quot; Community &quot;) . Their work goes beyond just a purely educational nature and becomes politicized. In autumn 1987 in Kiev appeared Ukrainian Cultural Club (UKK). In an attempt to hold a demonstration in 1988 before the second anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe UKK several leaders were arrested. At the end of 1987 out of prison and returned to Ukraine-known human rights activists, including Mr. Chornovil and M. Gorin, in January 1989 - L. Lukyanenko.
