During the war the colonial government promised to give India self-government. However, the Indians hope to be unfounded.</p><p class="rvps2"> All dissatisfied with the existing audio system went into opposition to the English authorities. The leading place in the national liberation struggle of occupied Indian National Congress (INC.), a recognized leader of which was M. Gandhi.</p><p class="rvps2"> Gandhism, which included the political, ethical and philosophical concept, rooted in Indian culture, found in the public review of Indian peasants and urban masses.

In people it was called Mahatma, meaning &quot;great soul&quot;. Widespread support for the methods used Gandhi&#39;s struggle, which did not include violence. The important thing was that Gandhi protest combined with tolerance to the colonizers.</p><p class="rvps2"> Under India with its diverse population, colorful religious and social composition of non-violent action was the only acceptable way of attracting people to the joint fight.</p><p class="rvps2"> Another powerful force in anti-colonial struggle was the Muslim League, which unlike INC. resorted to military action.</p><p class="rvps2"> English colonial administration in its fight against the liberation movement found support among Indian society - Rajiv (princes) and large landowners actively provoked religious and caste disputes.</p><p class="rvps2"> The immediate impetus for the rise of national liberation movement of 1918-1922 were the reforms which fixed the position of colonial India. Post-war rise of the national liberation struggle began with the mass strikes in the large industrial centers of Bombay, Madras, Kanpur, Ahmedabad.</p><p class="rvps2"> English colonial administration, to somehow pohamuvaty spontaneous movement, failed to reform governance.

This action could provoke violent riot spontaneous, but thanks to his lucky escape Gandhi.</p><p class="rvps2"> autumn of 1919 INC. Congress decided to boycott the elections. The boycott achieved its goal.</p><p class="rvps2"> Events in 1919 led to Gandhi&#39;s views on the need for a clear plan for further combat. In the first phase foreseen boycott campaign Colonial institutions and goods. The second - tax evasion. This has meant open conflict with the colonial administration.</p><p class="rvps2"> nonviolent resistance campaign began August 1, 1920, but in early 1922 events occurred that forced its collapse. In one village a crowd of peasants burned alive a few policemen. In Muslim areas rebellion broke out. British colonialists was thrown against the rebels forces. Gandhi condemned such actions and announced the termination action.</p><p class="rvps2"> stabilization period (1922-1929 years) India has experienced no major shocks, although once in a while one of the leaders INC. Jawaharlal Nehru called for full independence.</p><p class="rvps2"> world economic crisis adversely affected the economy of India. Vpaly prices for its main exports. And poverty ravage large parts of rural entrepreneurs and prompted the deployment of a new wave of national liberation movement. A new period was marked by anti-colonial struggle more organized and clarity of goals - independence and the constitution.</p><p class="rvps2"> impetus to the struggle was the arrival of the British commission of politicians who have had to develop a new constitution for India. Community India was outraged that the development of the constitution was resolved most famous Indian leaders. All Indian organizations boycotted the work of the British commission.</p><p class="rvps2"> INC. By decision began a new campaign of civil disobedience. January 26, 1930 declared the Independence Day of India. Signal to the second phase was to be demonstrative violation of the existing monopoly in India Colonial authorities in the production and sale of salt.</p><p class="rvps2"> In March 1930 Gandhi, accompanied by his followers went to three-week trip to the coast of the Arabian Sea, to evaporate salt from sea water. This trip had a huge impact on the Indian public. In some cities have begun spontaneous uprising. The riots spread and the army. The colonial authorities announced INC. outlawed. 60 thousand participants in the campaign was thrown into prison. But the movement did not stop and became yet more widespread. Across the country, people protested against the arrest of its leader. Members of mass demonstrations, given the covenants Gandhi did not use force, even when they are brutally beaten.</p><p class="rvps2"> further increased tension in the country and forced the colonialists INC. leaders for talks.</p><p class="rvps2"> In 1931 between the leaders INC. and the British government, signed the agreement which colonizers stop oppression and liberated prisoners, salt monopoly likvidovuvalas, INC. and stop the campaign of civil disobedience. Viceroy of India Edward Irwin (Lord Halifax) gave an illusory promise of future independence to India.</p><p class="rvps2"> Gandhi agreed to take part in a conference roundtable, convened in London to discuss the problems of India. Then the fight was moved to the negotiating table. At the conference, INC., submitted the draft constitution under the title &quot;On the fundamental rights and duties of citizens of India.</p><p class="rvps2"> conference concluded with a complete failure. Then, INC. in 1932 announced a new campaign of civil disobedience. In response colonizers banned INC. Gandhi and thrown into prison.</p><p class="rvps2"> But the British government understood that India should do something for the Indians eventually resolve the problems of independence in their favor. In 1935 the British Parliament adopted the Act of India, so Indian empire had become a federal dominion, which consisted of individual states. Suffrage received 12% of the population has expanded the rights of local legislative bodies, but kept the colonial system.</p><p class="rvps2"> In 1937, there have been elections that showed INC. authority. He won a majority in 8 of 11 provinces and local governments are formed. It was a big step forward in getting the power and the accumulation of a democratic, parliamentary experience. Despite the success INC. failed to unite people of all religious faiths in India. The Muslim League called on its supporters to fight for a separate Muslim province - the country of Pakistan (Countries of net &quot;).</p><p class="rvps2"> With the outbreak of World War II viceroy of India announced a belligerent country. India was on the side of anti-Hitler coalition. Implementation of the Act was postponed.</p><p class="rvps2"> powerful national liberation movement embraced other Asian countries. Thus, in 1919 Afghanistan won independence, which was forced to acknowledge the United Kingdom.
