<p class="rvps2"> result, the Earth&#39;s rotation around its axis is the change of day and night, the shape of the planet and rejection bodies (moving horizontally) in the northern hemisphere - right in the South - to the left.</p><p class="rvps2"> full rotation around its axis makes our planet in 24 hours (day). So, after an hour all points of the Earth (except poles) returned to 15 °. Given this fact, the territory of the planet is divided into 24 time zone, which is numbered from west to east - from zero to 23 zone th. Because of the uneven lighting on the globe every meridian at the same time different times of the day, it&#39;s called solar <i> <b> </b> </i> or <i> local </i> time. In fact, for ease of use <i> lap </i> time - time the central meridian of each zone. Local Greenwich meridian was adopted as <i> World </i>.</p><p class="rvps2"> As seen from the map, the boundaries of time zones often do not coincide with the meridians, they actually go through the borders and within the administrative-territorial formations. This is done for convenience. For example, the length of Ukraine in the degree dimension - 18 ° 05 &#39;(width of a time zone 15 °), therefore, our nation was to be in three time zones, but in fact, Ukraine is in one zone.</p><p class="rvps2"> through the Earth&#39;s rotation around the axis of the planet is a conventional line that divides the place in that same time have a calendar date with a difference in one day. This line is mainly on 180 th meridian line and called <i> </i> <i> Date Line </i>.</p>
