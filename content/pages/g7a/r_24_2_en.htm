<h2> Climate </h2><p class="rvps2"> geographical position makes mainland arrivals during the year a significant number of solar radiation and the presence of almost all high temperature. A predominance of continental masses and tropical air descending movements makes the driest continent.</p><p class="rvps2"> Much of the continent lies in the latitudes where the predominant pasatna circulation. Pacific air masses did not bring significant rainfall in the hinterland of the continent: <i> Great Dividing Range </i> captures trade winds and moisture is abundant precipitation only on windward slopes and narrow coastal strip. Almost 40% of the continent receives less than 250 mm of rain per year and only 10% - more than 1000 mm per year.</p><p class="rvps2"> Australia is located in three climatic zones: <i> <b> subekvatorialnomu, tropical </b> </i> and subtropical <i> <b> </b> </i>.</p><p class="rvps2"> for the northern part, which is in subekvatorialnomu zone characterized by high (about 25 ° C) temperature throughout the year and a large (about 1500 mm) rainfall, which is distributed unevenly throughout the year. Summer here is very humid with thunderstorms rains and dry winter.</p><p class="rvps2"> In the tropical climate zone of generally high temperatures (in summer 30 ° C, winter 16 ° C) for moistening distinguish two types of climate: <i> continental tropical </i> of rainfall to 200 mm year and peak amplitudes of temperature and humid tropical <i> </i> (up to 2000 mm of rain per year).</p><p class="rvps2"> subtropical zone of the southern part of the continent is characterized by a positive temperature throughout the year with a significant difference in the rainfall of western and eastern parts of the zone. Yes, the south-western Australia is located in the Mediterranean-type climate with dry summers and wet winters. The central part of the belt - the region&#39;s continental subtropical <i> </i> climate with dry hot summers and relatively cold winters. In the Southeast - <i> humid subtropical </i> type climate with uniform rainfall throughout the year.</p><p class="rvps2"></p><h2> Natural Area </h2><p class="rvps2"> The largest area of tropical <i> <b> semi-desert </b> </i> represented <i> Victoria Desert and the Great Sandy Desert </i>, which in coastal areas are moving in semi-desert.</p><p class="rvps2"> characteristic of these places is red surface caused by high content of iron compounds in the sand.</p><p class="rvps2"> presence very much, both deserts, flora here is explained near deposits of underground waters. <i> Solitary acacia bushes </i> and eucalyptus <i> </i> in some places pass into impenetrable thickets, along rivers and sometimes there are whole groves of eucalyptus <i> </i>. With animals living here <i> ostriches emus, kangaroos, lizards and poisonous snakes </i>.</p><p class="rvps2"> Zone <i> <b> moist evergreen rain forest </b> </i> on the red-yellow soils feralitnyh - a narrow strip in the east of the mainland. Warm climate and sufficient moisture is causing the development of diverse vegetation: <i> Eucalyptus, Araucaria </i>, various kinds <i> palms, ferns, bamboo </i>. The rich here and fauna, and some of the inhabitants of these places is generally endemic <i> (marsupials letyaha, koala, echidna, bird of paradise) </i>.</p><p class="rvps2"> the far southwest - Zone <i> <b> tverdolystyh evergreen forests and scrub </b> </i>. In eastern subtropical zone - the zone of mixed forests <i> <b> </b> </i> on the red-yellow soils with palm trees and evergreen beech <i> </i>.</p><p class="rvps2"> In area <i> <b> savannas and woodlands are </b> </i>, which occupy large territories in the north and eastern Australia, characterized by different types <i> eucalyptus, acacia, bottle trees </i>, growing on red and brown soils. <i> kangaroo, platypus, emu ostrich, Wombat </i> - representatives of the local fauna.</p>
