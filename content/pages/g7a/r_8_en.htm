<p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> soil </i> </b> - is the top layer of loose rocks, transformed by common action components and non-living wildlife (solar heat, air, water, plants, animals, bacteria). Rocks (sand, clay, loess) play a significant role in soil is called bedrock <i> </i>.</p><p class="rvps2"> main component of soil humus is <b> <i> </i> </b> (humus), which determines soil fertility - the powerful content of humus, the soil rodyuchishyy.</p><p class="rvps2"> variety of factors determine soil extraordinary diversity of soils, which comprise hundreds of species. The basis of their classification is based on differences in soil structure, composition, color, capacity humus layer.</p><p class="rvps2"> the most important factors include the distribution of soil heat and moisture, because every natural area corresponding to certain types of soils. Thus, the most common red and yellow <i> </i> soil moist equatorial forests formed under the influence of considerable heat and moisture. Further from the equator they vary formed by alternating moisture conditions <i> red </i> soil. In the deserts <i> gray </i> and <i> storm </i> desert soils are formed under the influence of excessive heat and insufficient moisture. They actually do not have humus and because agriculture is possible only with artificial hydration (oases) or along river valleys, which formed a special <i> intrazonalni </i> soil - <i> alluvial river plains </i>. Further, under the influence of different ratio of heat and moisture, alternately, go <i> gray forest, podzol </i> grounds. Most fertile soil on Earth is <i> black </i>, which is one of the greatest treasures of our state.</p><p class="rvps2"> soil can vary greatly influenced by human activity. There are many examples where due to irresponsible human activities on the site of former fertile lands arose career, piles, dumps, etc.. Designed to prevent this <i> Reclamation </i> land (restoring damaged lands) and the comprehensive approach that must consider all the possible consequences for the environment, which can cause economic activity of man.</p>
