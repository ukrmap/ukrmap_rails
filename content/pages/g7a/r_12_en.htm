<p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> Atlantic Ocean </i> </b> is the second area after the Pacific Ocean. In the meridional direction it extends across all geographical zones of 16 000 km and this explains a great diversity of climatic conditions. Ocean water is very warm, though in the extreme south and north the temperature drops below 0 ° C, and therefore for local areas is a common floating icebergs.</p><p class="rvps2"> width of the Atlantic Ocean near the equator least so it felt the impact most continents of the ocean.</p><p class="rvps2"> bottom contour presented <i> North Atlantic </i> and The North <i> bosses </i>, as well as smaller ranges and individual basin. Maximum depth of the sea reaches 8742 meters (Puerto Rico Trench).</p><p class="rvps2"> Atlantic coastline is divided into the northern hemisphere: there are large bays, seas and many islands. In tropical latitudes of some of the islands formed due to the increase of coral shelves.</p><p class="rvps2"> A large size and considerable length of ocean climate is extremely diverse. The water temperature decreases towards the equator to the south and north. Water salinity ranged from 8 ‰ in the Baltic Sea to 37 ‰ in tropical latitudes. As much air circulation and water mass Disorders zonal distribution of temperature and salinity distribution.</p><p class="rvps2"> organic rich world of Atlantic fish (<i> mackerel, tuna, cod, herring </i>), mammals (<i> whales, seals, sea elephants </i>) and many others representatives of wildlife. In the waters of the ocean is intensive fishing and seafood.</p><p class="rvps2"> Because ocean shores washed by many countries (including USA, Canada, Western Europe), here lie the main sea routes. Ocean waters is the lion&#39;s share of world passenger and cargo traffic. Atlantic Ocean is connected to the Indian <i> Suez Canal </i>, and the Pacific - <i> Panama Canal </i>. The opening of these channels respectively in 1869 and 1914 years is much reduced sea routes between countries and continents, as well as pozhvavylo navigation.</p><p class="rvps2"> intensive economic use of the ocean has its negative consequences. Large area of the central part of its highly contaminated as a result of accidents of oil tankers, sinking boats and dumping of nuclear waste different. All this causes great damage to the ocean and encourages international environmental organizations struggle to maintain a consistent reduction of technological and ocean conservation of its biodiversity.</p>
