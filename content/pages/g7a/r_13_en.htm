<p class="rvps2"> It is safe to say that a man traveled throughout their lifetime. Archaeological excavations indicate that for 10 thousand years ago, people sailed the Mediterranean Sea. Now the first written evidence of the long journey to reach us from the third millennium BC: Egyptian sailors mastered the sea route to the east coast of Africa and southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p class="rvps2"> course, the motives of those trips were different: the opening and conquer new lands, acquiring new trade routes, searching for El Dorado, satisfying their curiosity more. But surely the fact that it travels and discoveries were determining factors of world progress. With each expedition expanding horizons of knowledge of geography, astronomy and medicine. Discover new lands gave an opportunity for people to exchange goods, technology, cultural achievements, enriching each other. However, it happens so that new discoveries or disposed of newcomers absorbed whole nations with their unique culture.</p><p class="rvps2"> Most expeditions were oceans and seas. Given the imperfection of the vehicles in the past (canoe, pirogue, sailboats), one can only wonder at the courage and endurance, for example, <i> Norman </i>, which is on the verge of the first and second millennia BC overcame the cold waters of north Atlantic huge distances.</p><p class="rvps2"> can hardly remember all noble and simple travelers who value their health or even life opened to us the oceans and seas, continents, islands, straits. But there are figures whose achievements can be considered a turning in the history of mankind: <i> Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, James Cook, penguins </i>. It was after these expeditions people radically changed picture of the Earth or some of its regions, and humanity came out at a new level of development.</p><p class="rvps2"> course, one of the most remarkable figures in world history was Christopher Columbus.</p><p class="rvps2"> This man through perseverance and courage could overcome not only the difficulties that fell during her travels, but also endure charges of waste of money to wandering aimlessly. The result of his four expeditions was the discovery of the New World (America), although the Columbus until his death believed that discovered the shortest route to India. Paradoxically, the very hero spent the last years of his life in wanderings and died in poverty. Only after the death of explorer mankind appreciated his feat. Although the results of his discoveries were not only positive: new ground colonizers viewed primarily as an enrichment facility, was taken out of gold and other valuables, destroyed the indigenous culture, thousands of people were sold into slavery. Still Columbian can put on a par with the greatest achievements of mankind, such as flight into space, the invention of drugs for fatal diseases, conquering the ocean depths and so on.</p>
