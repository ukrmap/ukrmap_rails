Transition zones (or subpoyasy) characterized seasonal dominance of different air masses coming from the neighboring main zones.</p><p class="rvps2"> Depending on the set of indicators of climate (average temperature, annual amplitude of temperatures, the amount and mode of precipitation, prevailing winds) distinguish <i> types </i> climate. In addition, due to significant differences in climate, marine and continental areas within the same climatic zone variations distinguish the main types of climate - <i> climatic region </i> (<i> desert and wet </i> - a tropical climate, <i> Continental, Mediterranean, monsoonal, with a uniform damp </i> - sub-tropical climate, <i> continental, temperate continental, maritime, monsoonal </i> - temperate climate).</p><p class="rvps2"> The map presented climatic zones and areas with the characteristics of their basic conditions: solar radiation, prevailing air masses, seasonal temperature fluctuations.</p><p class="rvps2"> climate is one of the main factors moving living organisms on the planet.
