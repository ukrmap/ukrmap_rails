<p>The essence of the Bolshevik policy was to present the destruction in Ukraine economic system based on commodity-moneyrelationship and its replacement by direct barter. This policy has received inRussia called &quot;war communism&quot;.</p>

<p class="select"><strong>War Communism</strong> - Domestic Politics Soviet power established during the Civil War toconcentration of all labor and material resources in state hands.Characterized by widespread nationalization of industry,centralization of industry, freedom Bantrade, and labor input prodrozkladky duties.</p>

<p>An important part of the policy of &quot;war communism&quot; was the processnationalization of the means of production. The decree of nationalization orderbusinesses gave her the right to exclusively USSR government. Lawanticipated socialization primarily large companies that havestate matter. To guide this process in the republic wascreated the Ukrainian Council of National Economy (URNH). During 1920 state were over 11 thousand enterprises from 82% of workers.Companies that passed by the state, often obscured by the decline of labor discipline, lack of raw materials and escaped workers who do notzadurno almost like work.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks believed that the way out of this predicament can be militarization of the economy. In late January 1920 in Ukraine wasestablished labor army. Its functions included provision of raw materials andFood, fuel extraction, providing enterprise workforceet al. Hard reality of the new government does not coincide with its promises that workers become owners of plants and factories.</p>
<p>Peasant question for the Bolshevik Party was one of the mostpainful. Social support for party calling the working class, andpeasantry believed only ally, and that not everything, but poor. To Most farmers Soviets treated cautiously because theywere the natural owners of the means of production. Therefore, the Bolsheviks sought spread and nationalization of agriculture.</p>
<p>Even in 1919 they launched agrarian reform, which was conducted bytransfer of confiscated lands first collective farms, andonly marginally - the peasants. Such transformation of outrage peasants.The Bolsheviks, fearing that the situation in the country can get out ofcontrol, were forced to make concessions. Authorities trying to wincommitment of the Ukrainian peasants gave them nearly half the landFund sugar factories. Even these measures are not taken off social tensionsin the village. Ukrainian peasants believed that the Soviets did not justifytheir expectations.</p>
<p>At the village and spread policy of war communism. Personaltorhivlyuya food was forbidden. At the end of February 1920Sovnarcom USSR was to ensure the towns and army foodpassed a law on food layout.</p>

<p class="select">Food keyboard - a system of food preparationsproducts and agricultural raw materials, based on compulsorybarter and confiscation.</p>

<p>Each province was determined amount of grain it had putstate. This number &quot;rozkladalas&quot; local authorities to individual peasant economy. After passing the standards of grain farmers remained onlycost of living and seeds, the rest were taken without anyrecoveries. Make prodrozkladky were ad hoc bodies.</p>
<p>Farmers responded to these measures the new surge of armed struggle. ThenBolshevik government resorted to the old well-known method - divide and Conquer. In May 1920 under the decision of Central Executive Committee were establishedcommittees of poor peasants.</p>

<p>After signing the agreement Warsaw Poland, joining forces withUPR, April 25, started a war against RSFRR. Poles having significantsuperiority in manpower and technology, struck in the West and the jointSouth-Western Front. Against the Bolsheviks were unitedPolish and Ukrainian troops, which numbered 20 thousand Polish and 15thousand Ukrainian soldiers. They tried using the suddennessattack, the Red Army to surround and destroy it. During the first week of battlesAllied forces dislodged the Bolsheviks from Zhitomir, and BerdychivaKozyatyn. But despite considerable progress, troops under the commandJ. Pilsudski could not encircle the Soviet armed groups, and thismeant that the war was prolonged. Then attack the Poles and Petliuritesbegan to ebb. The last of their great success with the recognition of May 6, 1920by Kyiv. Three days later the Polish Army and the People&#39;s Republic of trying todevelop success forsuvaly Sky, but were stopped on the lineVyshgorod-Brovary-Borispol. Troops halted progressJ.

<p>Keeping Polish occupation troops was a heavy burden forUkrainian population. Formally, the agreement, the arrival of Poles look like Ukrainian help in liberating their land from the Bolsheviks. Actuallyheld Polish occupation of Ukraine. Administration of the People&#39;s Republic officiallytook shape in early July. However, its capabilities were limited.Poles often ignored it in Volhynia and Podolia it does notformed, and the government is concentrated in the hands of the Polish crown.</p>
<p>From the first days of stay in Ukraine began to export industrial Poles equipment, various products and raw materials. Throughout the entire Ukrainian territorydeployed looting, repression, the Jewish pogroms. All this has causedresistance of the Ukrainian population and the armed opposition to the Poles.J. Pilsudski repaired rebels against regular troops, who brutally cruelly with the local population. Mass executions of peasants revoltPoles carried out in Dubno, Rivne, Starokonstantinov and other cities.</p>
<p>In addition to natural peasant speeches against the Poles were undergroundorganizations, mostly led by the Bolsheviks or representatives of othersocialist parties. In late May, active organizational activitydeployed Zafrontove Bureau of the CC CP (b) U. It was not limited onlypreparation of the Ukrainian population revolts against the invaders, but alsocarried out the anti-war propaganda work among Polish soldiers.Ukrainian Bolsheviks established even issue of &quot;ZholhnezhPolish, Polish soldiers for printed leaflets, pamphlets, proclamations,which urged them to turn their arms against authorities J.
