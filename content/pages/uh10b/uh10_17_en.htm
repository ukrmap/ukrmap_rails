Germansrealized that the presence of the Ukrainian delegation in Brest will give themadditional leverage in negotiations. 13 (26) December Germanyand its allies told the Central Council that they are willing to deal withUPR in the negotiation process.</p>
<p>Negotiations began in late December, which consisted of about400 official and unofficial representatives of participating countries. CountriesQuadruple Alliance UPR recognized sovereign state entitled to conclude international treaties.</p>
<p>January 27 (February 9) in 1918 between the UPR and Germany and its alliessigned a peace treaty that reaffirmed the war betweencontracting parties without annexations and indemnities. The boundaries between the UPR andAustria-Hungary admitted to the agreements pre-war time, and with Polandplanned to identify them through further negotiations on the basisethnographic approvals and subject to the desires of the population. Partiesrefused to claims for damages caused by war, anticipated exchange of prisoners and resumption of mutualeconomic relations.</p>

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi with its environment</strong></p>
<p>The basis of the Hetman&#39;s government made the moderate conservativeminded officials, military and public figures. They believed thatUkrainian state should ensure the political stability thatbased on principles of private property. Domestic PolicyHetmanat aimed at strengthening the Ukrainian State, which had dominate the interests of wealthy citizens. Heads theCouncil of Ministers was F. Lyzogub - Poltava landowner, MinisterForeign Affairs - D. Doroshenko, Minister of Education and the Arts -AM Vasilenko, Minister of Justice - M. Chubynsky.</p>
<p>The main objective of the Hetman&#39;s administration was the creationan effective government, the elimination of anarchy, settingeconomic life. Bureaucracy cited authoritarian orderand repressive methods. In Ukraine, a wave of arrestsSentences, executions. Primarily for burning them, those who have recentlyled the local authorities carried out the confiscation of the landlords andlands. Considerable attention was paid to the creation of armed forces. Beganopened special schools training officers, wasdeployed to form the eight buildings and several cavalry divisions.However Hetman forbidden to enter the military and political partiesassociations, participate in rallies and demonstrations.</p>
<p>One of the first acts of the new government was the restoration of the landlordtenure, which would provide state trade bread. In JulyHetman in 1918 passed a law on means of combating rural ruin economy. For his farms actually given away inavailable to landowners who acquired the right to use compulsorymanors implements peasants. Recently started to resort to strikesfield work, but the government is punishing them by imprisonment.Trying to relieve tension, Hetman promised to take steps to redemptionlarge owners of land in empowerment for its rural poor. Butfurther pledges did not go right.</p>
<p>All events took place on Ukrainian life accruing background requirementsby the occupation forces against the supply of food and raw materials toGermany and Austria-Hungary, an agreement on who signed with P. SkoropadskyiGovernments of the Union State. In Ukraine a real warhetman and occupation troops against the peasants. But to meet the requirementsHetman occupants failed.</p>
<p>Complicated was the situation in the industry that finds itself at waralmost in full decline. Many businesses were destroyed,reconstruction of their missing funds. The government forced the workers fortiny fee to work intensively. A serious threat to manylabor groups became close plants, including raw materialsexported to Germany. In May 1918, a congress in Kievrepresentatives of industrialists, financiers and landowners. Under the pressuregovernment moved in to attack workers&#39; rights by removing the 8-hourtime, limiting the freedom of trade union activities and prohibitedstrikes.</p>
<p>Thus, the burden to overcome the economic crisis has been translated intoshoulders of workers. However, extreme measures have given the authorities an opportunity to changegeneral situation for the better. Began to form national bankingsystem innovations and currency - Hryvnia - proved verystable. It was possible to reopen the railway.</p>
<p>Big changes have occurred in education and a cultural area. The resultthis activity was the discovery of almost 150 Ukrainian schools.

<p>However, the Ukrainian state government implemented an active foreignpolicy. Priority had relations with Central Asian countries.Getman had to take into account the presence of allied troops in Ukraine.However, he skillfully played on contradictions between Germany and Austria-Hungary, military and diplomats. Hetman helped bolster his visit to Germany and talks with Wilhelm II in summer 1918</p>
<p>Important place in Ukrainian diplomacy was paid to relations withSoviet Russia. Under the agreement Brest Ukraine and Russiahad to sign another agreement on ending the war. This agreement was reached in June 1918 In addition, between Ukraine and Russiarenewed transport and postal and telegraphic communications.

<p>The biggest contradiction and complexity in relations between Ukraine andSoviet Russia have problems with borders that the end addressfailed. With respect to Romania, which seized BessarabiaP.

<p>Diplomacy Skoropadsky reached as far allied and neighboringStates. Hetman made significant efforts to establish internationalrelations with the U.S., Britain, France, Sweden and others. UkrainianState has established relations with 13 countries. Thus, Ukraine confidentlyappeared on the international scene.For a short time and the positive change in the economic lifestate. But administration hard methods, pressure and reprisalscaused the dissatisfaction of broad strata of the Ukrainian population.</p>
<p>Specific activity was noted peasantry that refused to givezadurno power increase, expanding the armed struggle against the hetman and occupation troops, which carried constant requisition. Summer 1918large scale peasant came in speeches and ZvenyhorodskyTarascha counties. The Germans were forced to give up their insurgency againstthe best part of the armadillo and even aircraft. Subsequently, the armedvillagers joined the fight Berdichivska Vassilkovsky,Kanev, Skvirskogo, Uman et al. counties. On the Right BankThe rebels numbered over 40 thousand people. Peasant groups have been wellarmed, they had machine guns and cannons.</p>

<p>Was thrown against the rebels government troops, but peasant groupsavoided open battles. With the support of the local population, they weresuddenly attacked small detachments of the enemy, he inflictedlosses and quickly disappeared.

Within six months, fightinginsurgent-partisan movement occupying troops lost in Ukraine 19 thousand soldiers and officers.</p>
<p>Hetman fought against the regime and the workers. In July andAugust 1918 ceased to about 200 railwaymen. Itsignificantly affected the exportation of food and raw materials to Germany andAustria-Hungary.</p> 
<p>Hetman was difficult relationship with the political regimeparties. Their leaders accused Skoropadsky that hepreferred in the formation of royal government officials, notUkrainian politicians. After all opposition parties in early August 1918he created a new unit called - Ukrainian National Association (UNA). ONS elected Chairman Vynnychenko who do not have sufficient forcesto deal with the regime Skoropadsky, entered into negotiations withUkrainian Bolsheviks, and their Russian party members. SovnarcomONS promised to help when he begins an uprising against the Hetman.</p>
