<p>The remains of defeated Denikin troops in the Crimea led GeneralP. Wrangel, which appeared under more than 30 thousandWhites. Vostochny watching the developments inSoviet-Polish front. Once in June 1920, the Red Armymoved in a counter attack in large-scale vtyahnulas fighting against the Poles andPetliurites, White Guards came from the Crimea and began to move onDonbass. But due to lack of offensive forces stalled vrangelevtsevlate June on the line Kherson Nikopol-Berdyansk. But the Entente, which supported Wrangel, retreating trying to ease the situationPolish troops in the West of Ukraine, led the Whites startnew offensive. Then in mid-August, they threw in his last fightreserves. It was enthusiastically Aleksandrovsk, Sinelnikove, but on the approach toEkaterinoslav Whites army stopped.</p>

<p>Given the shortage of soldiers Vostochny decided to act togetherPetlura and in August 1920 began negotiations with the Government of the UPR. Hehad to consider the fact that half of his army wereoriginally from Ukraine, and to recognize Ukraine&#39;s right to independently resolvetheir fate. It was essentially a new position of white movement in the Ukrainianissue that needs stipulated by the joint fight againstBolshevik regime. For the UNR had a contract with the Whitescompensate for the lost autumn 1920 Polish allies who havenegotiations with the Soviet leadership.</p>
<p>Find allies carried out not only Vostochny, but the Bolsheviks.In late September, they entered into an agreement with Makhno on joint action againstWhites. The Soviet government promised N. Makhno everything he wanted:Hulyaypolskomu autonomy to the district, to allow propagation ofanarchist ideas; release from Soviet prison arrestedMakhno and the anarchists and provide the insurgents with weapons and ammunition and others.</p>

<p>In these conditions, N. Makhno launch a campaign against Vostochny. InOctober vranhelivtsi caught in ticks in North Taurus, but they managed tolarge losses and move away to escape back to the Crimea, under the protectionTurkish shaft. P. Wrangel army turned it into an impregnable line Defense throughout Perekop isthmus.Soviet troops began to carefully prepare for the assault. With a vengeance advantage in people, they decided to attack the Crimean strengthening in twofronts - wade through Sivash and Turkish shaft.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Go Red Army crossed Sivash. From paintings of M. Samokish</strong></p>
<p>Sturm Perekopa began November 7, 1920 and lasted five days.Command of the Red Army not spared the people. One of the firstvranhelevski guns were thrown Makhno&#39;s men, on their bodies went to stormRed parts, some of them have lost 85% of personnelcomposition. After all, the price of great sacrifices (the bodies were filled up ditchdepth of up to ten meters), Soviet troops invaded the Crimea, whereVostochny stop them could not. November 13 Whites dislodged from Simferopol, later the Red Army invaded Feodosia, Sevastopol, Kerchand other cities. November 17 was the Soviet Crimea completely.</p>
<p>During the recent battles Vostochny managed to evacuate about 150 thousandWhites and refugees to Turkey. But about 300 thousand soldiers and civilians who are not experienced by a transgression against the Bolshevikauthorities have refused to leave home. They believe the statementRevviyskrady which was promised to all who do not drag the Red Armyfull amnesty.</p>
<p>But the Bolsheviks, by setting its power in the Crimea, once deployedpreparation for large-scale repression. Local authorities, under the guisepopulation registration for the issuance of new documents and softwarerefugee work, started taxing people. After some time the penal authoritieshaving on hand with the given lists of registered place of residence,began routine arrests and mass executions. Among those shot overwhelmingmajority were not professional soldiers, and mobilized to the whiteArmy youth who had higher or secondary education. Service in the White Armysocial origin and education level were often the main reason for the death sentence. Exact numbers of red terror in the CrimeaNo, but based on the analysis of relevant sources, it is obvious thatfollowed by the tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Having grasped the Crimea, the Soviet leadership is not going to carry out theirpromises that they generously gave Makhno Perekopa before the assault.Moreover, the Bolshevik leadership instructed the commander of the SouthFront of M. Frunze, to develop a military operation to destroy Makhnogroups.</p>

<p>November 25 Red Army launched a massive operation to eliminate Makhno militias. The Soviets took part in them in the ringEvpatoria region, but could not destroy. Makhno broke through the front andfights broke from the Crimea. However, already being on the mainland Ukraineunder Tomakivka rebels faced with a big red connectivity.Makhno fought to the death, knowing that a pardon will not. Early fights they had 3,5 thousand and 1,5 thousand cavalrymen tachanok with machine guns andfinished it with several hundred riders and 25 Tachanka.</p>
<p>Simultaneously M. Frunze ordered to surround Gulyaypole where concentratedmain rebel forces led by N. Makhno. But Makhno&#39;s men, havingbeautiful cavalry formation, burst through the circle and connected the remnants of the Crimean group. A month Makhno&#39;s men again become formidable force. The Soviet government thrown against them manytroops, but completely break Makhno, who owned the perfect tacticguerrilla war, was not easy. This struggle existed for almost a year and only in September 1921 N. Makhno with a small group of his assistantsleft the Ukraine and went in exile.</p>
<p>Thus, the defeat vranhelivtsiv Makhno and throughoutUkraine is left forces that would resist Sovietpower.</p>

<p>Socio-economic crisis that engulfed the republic in the early 20&#39;syears was a serious threat to the Bolsheviks. The authorities made an attemptsolve the food issue by prodrozkladky. Requisition bread infarmers carried out involving troops. But it was a risky wayas the Red Army consisted of 77% of farmers. In addition, thispolicy questioned all previous achievements of the Communists.</p>
<p>In response to the violent tactics of the state, peasants againcome from the scabbard. In Ukraine launched an active partisan struggle of peasants, dissatisfied with the Soviets. In early 1921 inpart of the rebel groups there were about 40 thousand people. In February of the samein Ukraine there were 118 revolts. Rebel movement wereAreas covered skirts, Kyiv, Poltava and Katerinoslavshchina. Against &quot;War Communism&quot; and by the workers. The enterprises of KharkovKyiv, Odessa and other cities erupted in strikes, with both economicslogans were political - Anti-Bolshevik orientation. In the South, andLeft Bank of the rebels were under anarcho-communist slogans,encouraging the population to support the council, but without the Communists. In the restUkrainian territory struggle unfolding in nationalistflags.</p>
<p>However, during the years of revolution and civil war group formedlumpen elements of towns and villages that have been to lower politicalinstability and armed struggle against any government, has become theirform of existence. Further open confrontation in Ukraine, moreacquired nature mutual. After signing the Riga Peace forces UNR, who find themselves inPoland, by order of J. Pilsudski were interned in special camps.But Ukrainian soldiers do not fall into despair, they secretly Polish authoritiescreated groups of volunteers who made Resistance Army. Theyhoped to attach to it, all anti-Soviet forces in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In October 1921 Rebel army leadership developed the planhelp Partisan movement in Ukraine. It came to my mind the idea ofSecond Winter campaign, which was a strategic objective of raisingpopular uprising and overthrow the Bolshevik regime in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The second winter campaign started in November 1921 PensInsurgent Army crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border and walked withfought on the Bolshevik tylah. But the expected result of this action is notgiven. Ukrainian peasants were tired of the endless struggledifferent political regimes and was unable to organizedlong struggle. Rebel army itself is inferior to Sovietthe number of troops, weapons and equipment. EndNovember rebel troops were defeated by the Bolsheviks in Zhytomyr andonly a small group led by Yu Tyutyunykom lucky break onPoland. Ukrainian soldiers tried to organize new raids inUkraine, but after a protest of the Soviet government leadership Polishordered the insurgents to minimize such actions.</p>

<p>Fighting for Ukraine&#39;s independence was a logical extensionnational-democratic revolution, the purpose, which was the formation ofindependent and democratic Ukraine to build a justsocio-economic order.</p>
<p>At positions gradually gaining national independence wasUkrainian Central Council, reciting viddzerkalyuvalosya its universals. However, the inability of the Central Council to master the situation and achieverequired level of state and economic development, fightingUkrainian Bolsheviks, Soviet Russia, Increasing threattransformation of Ukraine to the German Governor-general, and in fact tocolony, has pushed for consolidation and enhancement of non-socialistforces, whose leader was an honorary chieftain Free Cossacks GeneralP. Skoropadskyi.</p>
<p>He and his supporters kept the idea of</p>
<p>The main pillar of the Hetman regime were the landowners, the bourgeoisie andold bureaucracy, largely Russified, they primarily interested instability and the norm of life and national ideas are especially not cared. The German defeat in the war has deprived the Ukrainian Statesupports. One-sided orientation to the propertied classes, the need to satisfy appetites Austro-German invaders led to the following socio-economic policyHetman&#39;s government, which led not to the consolidation of society, and todeepening the split in society and the formation of the opposition, which is quitequickly moved into action. So there and acted Directory UNR thatimagine an independence-political force.</p>
<p>However, the opposition bloc, united in the Directory consisted ofpolitical groups that had different interests, priorities andorientation. In part this is what explains these significant shortcomings Directory,unclear as software installations, contradictory and short-sighteddomestic policy. In addition, the lack of clear terms of the Agriculturalreform and a weak administrative apparatus for its implementationstrengthen social tension and insecurity. Not promotedconsolidation of society and the arrests and indiscriminate closure formed byHetman institutions ban use of Russian and deprivationvirtually the entire intelligentsia of political rights. These ill-considered stepsDirectory support deprived peasants and minority aidqualified staff. Its power substantially weakened and noexplicit state model. In this role, then claimed three significantlydifferent forms of social organization, parliamentary republic,Republic councils and military dictatorship. Over the years, Singaporesomehow approbated each model, but by realities,leading tendency was to strengthen the right-wing drift of the process andnation toward military dictatorship, which places graduallyturned into Otamanschina. It crashed within the Directory.</p>
<p>A disruption contributed and personal opposition leaderslack of unanimity on the priorities and political orientation. Thus, if Mr. Vinnichenko and his supporters defended&quot;Soviet platform, supported the alliance with Bolshevik Russia againstEntente and priority social issues, then, Petliura withhis cronies inclined to rapprochement with the Entente, and the primarytask of strengthening the independence of the country considered by strengthening the army and its administration. In addition to these factors, her furthercollapse of the significant role played by lack of financial support andarmament, insufficient funding, poor sanitary condition(Autumnal fever epidemic in 1919 reduced the personal army of 3 / 4).</p>
<p>A series of diplomatic steps (of the Act and the reunification of the UPRWest Ukrainian National Republic (ZUNR) into a single unified state,attempts to establish contacts with the Entente, signed in April 1920military and political convention between the governments of Poland and UPR) Directoryattempted to withdraw the state from political isolation, to find a meansstrengthening their diplomatic, financial and military positions. But thesesteps were unsuccessful. Act of reunification was largelyformal, Ukraine existed between the two major differences,and led to the conclusion that Petliura agreement with the Polish Government, in accordance withwhich he refused to western regions (one month beforethis, to November 1919, Galician General Tarnavsky forfurther struggle with Poland turned their militias underCommand white). Finally, to negotiate with the Entente directory and not failed because Western politicians bet on recoveryThe one and indivisible, and therefore in support of the Voluntary Army.Proved ineffective and the union with Poland, as during the Soviet-PolishWar does not restore power to the UPR in Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>Rejected the idea of</p>
<p>Thus, the struggle for independence in a brutalinternal intestine wars, bloody civil war between the Ukrainian,ended in defeat in the struggle with external forces. However, this struggle was of great historical significance.</p>
