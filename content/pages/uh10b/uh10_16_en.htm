<p align="center"><strong>The beginning of the liberation of the Ukrainian people. Formation of the Ukrainian National Republic (March 1917 - March 1918)</strong></p> 


<p>October 25, 1917 in Petrograd armed uprising prevailed duringleadership of the Bolshevik Party. As a result of the rebellion, the powerProvisional Government was overthrown. Second Congress of Soviets declaredRussia, the Republic of Soviets of Workers, Soldiers and Peasants Deputies andapproved the Soviet government - the Council of People&#39;s Commissars (RNA).</p>
<p>The victory of the Bolsheviks in Petrograd, encouraged them to spread theirpower to the rest of the territory, including Ukrainian. This struggle theylaunched under the slogan: the land - the peasants, factories - workersworld - people, authorities - councils. The greatest support for the Bolsheviksused in proletarian districts of Donbass, which received the majoritylocal councils. In other parts of Ukraine, their social base was weak and establish their own power they could. To resolve this problems the Bolsheviks tried to use local zbilshovyzovanigarrisons in Zhmerynka Nemiroff, Kamenetz-Podolsk, Rivne,Starokonstantinov et al. But then, the initiative is again passed toCentral Council. In the winery, fighting ensued between troops loyal toInterim Government, and parts that have supported the Bolsheviks. Inresult of the Bolsheviks seized power and held it to the end of November, then control over the city took over the Central Council.</p>
<p>Competition for power and opened in Kiev. First Central Councilsympathetic attitude to the Bolsheviks, considering its main enemy Provisional Government. Together with the socialist minority groupsOctober 25 (7 November) it created a National Committee for the Protection ofRevolution, was aimed not pass through Ukraine counterrevolutionary troops that went to Petrograd to suppress the Bolshevik uprising.But making sure that the Soviets intend to extend its authority and toUkraine, UCR negative attitude to the events in Petrograd and condemnedBolshevik revolution.</p>

However, it resulted in mass strikes and armed the workers. Management Staff of the Kiev militaryCounty had to go for talks. The result was an agreement bywhich the responsibility for keeping order in Kiev assumed the Central Council,which at that time controlled the key points of the city. Gradually a largenumber of troops of the Provisional Government left Kyiv. The Bolsheviks agreedrecognize the Central Council boundary government in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The severity of the political situation in Ukraine as a result of armedconflict in the struggle for power amplified activity of the Bolsheviks,associated with the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets.
