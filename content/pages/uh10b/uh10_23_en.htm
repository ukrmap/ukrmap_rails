<p>In a short time in private and public funds the Central Councildeployed construction Ukrainian school, were founded in 1953 UkrainianHigh School, made training programs, plan Ukrainizationschool.</p>
<p>However, the development of Ukrainian national education provoked resistance fromthe conservative part of educators. Especially strong were thetrends in higher education. But did the Central Council to thisproblems democratically, trying not to aggravate the situation. In highereducation studies carried mixed language. However, powerendeavored to encourage professors to reading coursesUkrainian. Universities started: Department of HistoryUkraine, Ukrainian literature, Ukrainian language and law.
