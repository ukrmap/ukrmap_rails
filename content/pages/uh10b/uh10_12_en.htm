<p>The war worsened the economic situation in Russia and Austria-Hungary.And it affected the Ukrainian lands. From the earliest days of the war mostserious problem for the Dnieper area was lack of fuel. Russialost to the Germans occupied Poland, Dombrowski minefield that gave 20% of the all coal mining. Donbass remainedthe only major source of supply of military industry and railwaysfuel. These were brought tens of thousands of Chinese workerslaborer from the Central Asian regions of the empire, 75 thousandPOW soldier Austro-Hungarian army. New workers wereinefficient, and forced labor of prisoners of war wasineffective. The measures taken have allowed little to increase coal productionrelative to prewar levels. However Donbass could not meet demandEmpire in the fuel.</p>
<p>No better was the situation with the production of iron ore. In its Kryvorizhiaproduction in 1916 declined by 27% compared with 1913 Coal Shortageand iron ore has led to a reduction in metallurgy and metal shortagesthreatened to undermine the weapons production. In the Russian Ukraine in two During the war closed 532 businesses. Those who survived, worked inmainly on the war, but their equipment is barely updated.</p> 
<p>In 1917 it came true because of the collapse at engineering plants.Lack of fuel and metal (rails production in 1916 declined bythird compared with the pre-war time) led to disruption to transport. In end of 1915 due to lack of fuel and transport disruptiondue to the rapid retreat of the Russian army on the railroad backlog150 thousand cars from unsent goods.</p>
<p>The war has complicated the situation in agriculture. During the war years in Dnieper left the village only 38,7% of able-bodied menthe rest were at the front. A requisition of horses for the Army almost halffarms had no traction force. As a result, the 1917 planting area in Ukraine decreased in comparison with pre-war time by 21,3% andyield of 8%. Rapidly growing shortage of food.</p>
<p>Heightened social tension. Trying to defend their interests,workers resorted to strikes. Between 1914 and 1917 took place in Ukraine400 strikes, which was attended by almost 300 thousand people. Notremained aloof and peasants. From August 1914 to end 1916 inUkrainian lands happened about 200 peasants were speeches that act despair and testified about the inability to continue to tolerate the burden of war andlandowner arbitrariness. Government responsible for such activities repressionarresting strikers and sending them to the front. Discontent Government covered the general public and transmitted to the army. Soldiers beganrefuse to fight, seemed to deliberately capture, resorted todesertion, bratalysya the enemy.</p>
<p>The most acute form of protest were soldiers rise. Yes, 25October 1916 was made six thousand soldiers covered antiwar sentiment at the recruiting office in Kremenchuk.The government tried to control the situation not only violentmethods, but also through the influence of NGOs, which emerged from itsauthorization: the company, military and industry committees and committees helpvictims of war. Yes, thanks to the activities of the Provincial and Municipalgovernments have been created to assist the front - Union and Union zemstvacities. Committee of the All-Russian union of cities in South-Western Frontcame under the control of Ukrainian leaders who were able todirect the organization through this large amount of money from the state budget Galicia residents who find themselves in Dnieper.</p>
<p>Summer of 1915, there were the Society to the population of South Russia,affected by the hostilities &quot;based Ukrainian intelligentsialands. It was intended to help the sick and wounded soldiers andrefugees. In addition, during the war on the ground have createdpublic committees which assisted health servicehelped create shelters for orphans werecultural and educational work. With committees in Lviv and Kiev activelycollaborated Vyazlov A., D. Doroshenko, A. Nicovsciy, F. and Matushevskiyother known members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia. Community partnerships and committees of the victims ended operations in 1917 However, all attempts of liberal government and the public to overcomesocio-economic and political crisis failed.</p>

<p>Complicated was the situation in Western Ukraine, which became the scene fierce battles. During the war years in Galicia was destroyed over 40%commercial and residential buildings more than 1,5 thousands of industrial facilities.The civilian population was used for defensive works.

<p>Burden laid on the shoulders of people requisitioning productsfood, clothing, horses and other property held constantlyRussian and Austro-Hungarian administration starving population. Thus,November 1914 Drogobyts&#39;ka city council appealed to the RussianGovernor General of Galicia to assist 27 thousandstarving. In 1915, the famine embraced Transcarpathia. Particularly severe was the winter 1916 in Uzhgorod, where there was no bread. Cities were overcrowdedrefugees.

Western Ukrainianpopulation, as well as population Dnieper managed toantiwar protest (to avoid mobilization of the Austrianarmy desertion, surrender in captivity).

Consideringsituation, leaders of national movement in Western Ukraine have decided tochange tactics and reorganize the main board was created in UkrainianLviv at the beginning of the war to an organization to represent the interests ofUkrainian people. It was established May 5, 1915 called &quot;General Ukrainian Council (ZUR). The headquarters of the organization was located in Vienna. She became president K. Levitsky.

<p>In November 1916 the Austro-German bloc agreed to the formationKingdom of Poland, to which access was Galicia.

<p>In the Dnieper, few expected that the Austro-German troopsbring Ukraine national liberation. Did not produce results andUkrainian intelligentsia support the Russian government in the war. However,failure of the Russian army gradually changed psychological climate insociety. Provoked a wave of anti-government criticism in defeat and allowed Ukrainian raise their voice.In August 1915 the Minister of Education Ignatiev took the Ukrainian delegation inState Duma deputy part of Professor E. Ivanov, teacher andPublic activist and journalist Rusova S. F. Matushevskiy. Membersdelegation submitted an application for the needs of education in Ukraine andnecessity to introduce Ukrainian language in schools.</p>

<p>During this period the members of the State Duma Oleg Kerensky and M.
