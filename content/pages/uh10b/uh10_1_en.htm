Ukraine became a dissertation onprimary coal and metallurgical region of the Russian Empire with largeindustrial centers: Donetsk metallurgical coal, RigNikopol and iron and manganese pools, Southwestsugar region. The economy is increasingly integrated intothe all, expanding ties with other regions of the country.However, their economic development was controversial, because their shareaccounted for 70% of raw materials extraction and only 15% of finished products of the Russian  Empire. And because the cost of finished goods is much higher thanprices for raw materials, the Russian economy received from this greateconomic benefits. Moreover, most people lived in the village, so agricultural products industry prevailed overgoods. It is influenced by social and community development.</p>

Economic growth was again only1910-1914 biennium Then significantly increased coal production,production of pig iron and steel. At the time, Dnepr Ukraine producedalmost 70% of heavy industry and 80-85% sugar all over Russia. <br>In agriculture, the Ukrainian lands remained landownerZemo-levolodinnya. However, in terms of development of capitalism constantlythere was a process of social decomposition peasants: some rich, othersbidnily.

<br>
<p>In the late nineteenth century. - In the early twentieth century. in the world are formedtwo military-political blocs: the Triple Entente and the union. After a series oflocal armed conflicts 38 states involved in the First Worldwar, which killed 10 million people and more than 20 million were hurt.The war led to the disintegration of large states such as Austria-Hungary andRussia.

The burden of the war sharplyfelt the Ukrainian people, in the absence of their own country,which would protect his specific interests, appeared in two opposingcamps. About 3.5 million Ukrainian in the Russian army and 250-300 thousand in Austrian troops fought and died for foreign interest to them. Butthe worst was that the children of the same people, two redistributedStates were forced to kill one another. <br>Much of the territory of Ukraine found itself at pryfrontoviy area, inGalicia, Bukovina, Transcarpathia, the tail there were fierce battles. <br>The war had a devastating impact on the economy of the warring countriesare on the verge of exhaustion. Suffered the worst losses RussianEmpire and subsequently the Ukrainian lands in its stock. Ceasedforeign trade, stood vast Black Sea ports. Warsevered from the productive labor of millions of Ukrainian peasants andworkers. Plants and factories kept increasing militaryorders and reduced production of Consumer Goods. Grimand its aftermath led to sharp resentment among manystrata of the Ukrainian people, the growth of revolutionary liberation movement.In late 1916 - early 1917 overdue deep economicand political crisis. Ukrainian people, to withstand the earlyXX century. significant tests, quickly came to the new socialshocks. <br>Terms of war led not to collapse the Ukrainiannational liberation movement, but rather to strengthen it andexaltation.

<br>
<p>Analyzing the situation in Ukraine in early 1917, scientists historians  rightly claim that the Ukrainian revolution of 1917-1921was a logical result of the liberation movement in Ukraine anddue to a complex situation of the population in the Ukrainian landsexacerbated with the war and the general crisis in political systemsRussian Empire and Austro-Hungarian monarchy. <br>In February, 1917 as a result of the victory of bourgeois-democraticRevolution in the Russian Empire was overthrown autocracy. Already the firstnotification caused democratic change in Ukrainiansociety striving to bring speedy resolution of urgentproblems of national development. As historian wrote Hunczak, changes inUkrainian public life reflected the dynamics of the firstpolitical development of the Ukrainian community ... the idea of identity Ukrainian people, the concept of the Ukrainian state, and finallywas such a practical form of the Ukrainian Peoplerepublic, and later - the state of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky. <br>
