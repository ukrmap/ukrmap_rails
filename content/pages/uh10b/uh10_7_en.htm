Great expectations relied on agrarian reform thatassociated with the name of the head of P. Stolypin. It was planned perform for 15-20 years.<br>The main cause of agrarian reform was the existence of feudal survivalsin the village, which hampered the development of agriculture. Key amongthem - landlordism and rural communities. Rural communities were legal owners of the land without their permission peasants had no right to freely dispose of their holdings. Inside the community among its membersperiodic redistribution of land took place. In addition,peasant inheritance consisted of several bands (segments) located indifferent parts of the communal land. Thus, a farmer was not interested inapplication of agricultural machinery or agricultural innovation forAfter another redistribution of land he could get much worsequality. Many farmers do not have a working livestock and implements, handedput in your lease, but continued to be regarded as tax payers.Solidarity of peasants tied to the community. The consequences of such an orderwere impoverished peasants and strengthen its protest moods.<br>In addition, most farms had a natural character and not oriented to the market. Almost everything that went to farmers vyroschuvalosown needs. On the other hand, the demand for agricultural productsincreased due to rapid industrialization and urbanization.Failure to resolve the problems of the village, where about 80% of the populationDnipro region, entailed social tension, which were the result ofrevolutionary events of 1905-1907<br></p><div style="background-color: lightblue; width: 70%;" align="justify"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Agrarian reform was intended to solve a complex series of problems:</strong><br></p>    <ul>        <li>create a strong market-oriented commodity farming;</li>        <li>strengthen social support for the sovereignty of the village,eliminating community and passing peasant farmers land, whichthey enjoyed in private ownership;         </li><li>strengthen the peasants a sense of the owner and take their dissatisfaction government policy;         </li><li>landlordism save the partial sale of their lands rich peasant owners;         </li><li>alleviate overcrowding by agricultural organizationsstate migration of peasants from Ukraine to the poorly populated andAsian undeveloped areas of the Russian Empire.         <br>    </li></ul>    <em>Could the implementation of these tasks is really to solve agriculturalQuestions?

Make it through the planned introduction of a widemarket relations in rural areas and increase marketability of Agricultureeconomy, strengthening the economies of wealthy farmers. Ukrainian peasantry P. Stolypin measures perceived as getting rid of the sparsenessland lines (segments) and landlordism. But the imperialpower, adapting agriculture to capitalist conditionswhile trying to maintain landlordism. This policywas particularly relevant for central regions of Russia where feudalRemnants felt stronger. In Ukraine, agriculture wasalready &quot;saturated&quot; and the capitalist elements of P. Stolypin reform hadgreatest success. On the eve of reforms in the Dnieper peasants belonged96.4 million acres of land, landowners and 63.9 million acres. Therefore, furtherredistribution of landed estates with the adoption of reform quickened only.During the first three years of reform in Ukraine landlordismdeclined by 8.2%, and area landowners&#39; crops before the firstWorld War II was only 18% of the total.</p><p>However, diversity in forms of land ownership in Ukraine caused the differentresults of reforms in different areas. Thus, the destruction of communities wasimportant example for the Left Bank, where community-based land constituted 51.6%all land or Kharkov province (93.1% of communal lands).However, in Poltava province communities possessed only 17,9% of land, andRight Bank in general 3,5%. Clearly, the way peasants from the community activelyis carried out on the Left and the Kharkiv province.</p><p>P. Stolypin reform had success in Ukraine. This is explained in particularpsychological and historical peculiarities of the Ukrainian peasantry.Favorable natural conditions attached to effectively developindividual, Podvirna economy, which laid the traditionlandlordism. Bowery were typical business organizationUkraine since the second half of XVIII century. Relatively long,compared to Russia, the period of serfdom in the Dnieper nottraction destroyed Ukrainian peasants to private entities.During 1907-1915 pr. Right Bank went from 48% of rural communities,in the South - 42% of the Left - 16,5%. In 1916formed 440 thousand farms, which constituted 14% of peasant households. Theserates were significantly higher than in European Russia, where from the communityvydilylosya 24% of farms and hamlets pereselylos to 10,3%.</p><p>In the hamlet of resettlement farms had to be from 250 to500 rubles. Of course, not all farmers have the necessary funds, sovast majority of these farms created middle.</p><p>Important role in implementing the reforms played a Rural bank. Already during the 1906-1909 biennium Ukraine sold by landlordsbanks 423 hectares of land. The Bank in land acquisition to proceed to mainly prosperous peasants which would pay interest for the givencredits. Farmers who were unable to pay loans, lostland and it became the property of the bank. In 1906-1910 he peasantsUkraine bank bought 528 hectares of land, almost 83% of ownerswere purchased land owners and farm cuts. Banks bought not only landed estates, but those villagers who sold their plots,pereselyayuchys east of the Russian Empire.</p><p>An important component of the Stolypin agrarian reform wasimmigration policy. Over the years 1907-1914 from the European partRussian Empire on vacant land in the Ural moved 3.3 millionvillagers, including 1.2 million Ukrainian people. The main reasons for migration were:peasant land poverty and bezzemellya, difficult economic conditionsMost farmers harvest years 1908-1909 in Ukrainian provinces.</p><p>Immigrants granted 15 hectares of land on the head of the family and45 - the rest of its members. Ukrainian populated Siberia and Far Eastwhole districts. Thus, among the Ukrainian settlers in Primorsky Kraiaccounted for 75-80% in the Amur region - 60-65%. They immediatelyformed a settlement with their family names that have been preserved to this day: Pereyaslavka, Chernihivka, Upper monomials and others.</p><p>Move to new ground not only malozemelni farmers, but alsowealthy.
