Results of Ukrainian lands inhabited by 48 million peopleincluding 33 million Ukrainian people. <br>Ukrainian land which belonged to Russia, were merged into threeregions - governor-general to 3 in each province *:Little Russian (Chernihiv, Poltava and Kharkiv province)Kiev (Volyn, Podolsky and Kiev Province) and New Russia(Yecaterinoslav, Taurian and Kherson province).

However, their function was limited to questions of construction andmaintenance of local roads, development of agriculture, industry,trade, public health services, education, communication,fire protection.

Mostpowerfully these processes unfolded in Dnieper Ukraine, where the shareindustry in total production of all nationalsector was 48,3% (on average in the Russian Empire 40%).It worked more than 8 thousand factories, mines and otherindustry, more than 800 thousand workers.</p>

  </ul>

<br>
<p>The beginning of XX century. marked by a deep global economic crisis (1900-1903 biennium), which influenced the Ukrainian lands. Largestacute crisis has in heavy industry, particularly in iron ore andsteel. In Kryvorizhia in 1902 Ruden of 79 operated only 41. In 1903 Dnipro region in the south from 56 blast furnaces operatedonly 23. Issue locomotives in Luhansk and Kharkiv reduced by one third. The crisis touched by light and food industries. Players sugar factorieswere filled with salvage.</p> <br>

  <strong><em>Accommodation miners in the early twentieth century.</em></strong></p>
<p>A significant number of companies curtailed their activities, and thus began  rapidly increasing unemployment. In particular, 1903 in MinesIndustry was released one third of the workers. A total ofDnieper unemployed was 100 thousand workers. In Kharkovsyahala16 thousand unemployed in Yekaterynoslav - 15 thousand, inDonbass released one out of five. Size wages fell by 15-20%working hours had increased to 12-16 hours. <br>However, the economic crisis became the catalyst of potentialopportunities of the region that zahostryvshy competition and increasingpolarization enterprises forced the bourgeoisie and the most concentrated join forces. She was accompanied by absorption of weaker firmsstronger, decreasing the number of small factories and refinerieslarge increase, ie, significantly increased the concentration of production, reaching large, even compared to European countriessizes. The level of concentration of industrial production in majorareas of Ukraine has reached a dissertation on early twentieth century. one offirst places in the world. <br>The largest concentration of industrial production reached insuch industrial centers of Ukraine, as Ekaterinoslav, Luhansk, Kharkiv,Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Uzivka, Odessa. <br>Large companies usually do not belong to one individual but were* joint-stock companies, where capital peredilyavsya of shares (shares) andowners of shares (shareholders) in charge of the case company and received a share of the profit according to their interest. Only1905 Ukraine has established 285 joint stock companies was not no big steelworks, which was gone in like a stock company. <br>As a result of increased concentration of industry in some areasthere are companies (large companies), company or association (union) a monopoly position, controlling a significant portionproduction and marketing of certain types of products. Ability to significantly influence to market prices and volumes of supply of goods provided suchcompanies high profits. <br>The first <strong>monopoly</strong>That occurred in another bank Ukraine in 1893, was <strong>syndicate</strong>sugar industry. It brought together 203 of the 224 sugar factoriesbelonged to families Bobrinsky, Branytskys, Brodsky, PotockiTereshchenko, Kharytonenkos, Yaroshynskyh and produced 1.2 million tons of sugaryear (second place in the world after Germany).</p>

For example, the syndicate &quot;Prodvuhillya&quot; which consisted of 18 separate joint stock companies controlled 75% of productioncoal in the Donetsk basin. In Ukraine, there were 30syndicates, which had 60? 80% of industry sales of products. <br>

On the one hand, monopoly, if noteliminated cyclical industrial management, it still significantly mitigate theirdestructiveness. On the other hand, their owners, controlling a significant portionproduction in this or that field in order to raise prices for theirproducts often artificially maintained in the country lackfactory products, coal, etc..
