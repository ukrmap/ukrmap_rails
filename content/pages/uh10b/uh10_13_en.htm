<p>National revolution swept all Ukrainian lands, and was the productcollapse of the Russian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which were in at war with each other. But the main events of the early Ukrainianrevolution associated with the collapse of the Russian empire and the revolutionaryevents that it was enveloped.

<p>The main precondition for the growth of the revolutionary process was a generalsocial and economic crisis. At the beginning of 1917 became apparent collapseindustry, transport and agriculture.

<p>From the earliest days of the UCR its authority among the Ukrainian peoplebegan to grow rapidly because it advocated close to himsocialist ideas and the national-territorial autonomy. These ideas were for the UCR program. But its leaders some time consciously avoideddiscussion of acute socio-economic issues, following the mottoNational business primarily - social then. They feared that focus on social aspects could divide the national movement.Further development of political situation in Ukraine showed the falsity of suchpolicy. It turned for UCR loss of social support amongLabor groups of the Ukrainian population.</p>
