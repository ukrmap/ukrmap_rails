<p>General Secretariat immediately condemned the actions of rebels, and has writtenagainst them by the Central Council of faithful troops. This caused among rebelsconfusion, they began to hand over positions and leave Kyiv. Subsequently,Government troops surrounded the remnants of rebels and after a brief battle nearHrushky village near Kyiv disarmed them.

<p>After failing to Bolshevik coup in early July 1917 , in Petrograd, the Provisional Government took steps to consolidate his power. In the rear and front of the death penalty was introduced. The government began to collapsewinning the February Democratic Revolution: censorship was introduced,increased control over the activities of some parties.</p>

During the incident Bogdanovka twenty were killed and manywounded. However, in the Russian press opened in separate libelfigures of the Central Council. They were arbitrarily accused of secretrelations with the ruling circles of Austria-Hungary and Germany.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the Provisional Government began to view their promisesCentral Council and the agreements that were signed with her before. Specifically, hecategorically rejected the &quot;Charter of the General Secretariat, developedCentral Council and replaced it with &quot;instructions for InterimGeneral Secretariat of the Provisional Government of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Thus, the General Secretariat of the instructions recognized by localonly body of the Provisional Government and had it approved throughsubmission of the Central Council.

In addition, the competence of the secretariat withdrawn Secretariatmilitary, food, lawsuits, Railways, Post andTelegraph. The Provisional Government left the right in certain casescontact the authorities in Ukraine, bypassing the General Secretariat.</p>
<p>&quot;Temporary Instruction for the General Secretariat evoked inUkrainian society sharp backlash. Kiev &quot;LabourGazeta, August 6, characterized such actions, calling them &quot;pettyfraud.</p>
<p>In August, the address of the Central Council received hundreds of telegrams from allparts of Ukraine to the decisions and resolutions, where zasudzhuvalas policyProvisional Government.

<p>However, most members of the Central Council did not feel confident to Interim Government and opposition have begun offering new and different options compromise. Finally, the Central Council adopted the &quot;Instructions&quot;, though withindividual reservations.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Central Council to justify his compromising position bythat the Ukrainian people as if at that time was not ready for strongrevolutionary struggle against the imperial policies of the Provisional Government, althoughnot really ready for it were the heads of the Central Council. Evidenceso was the failure of the Central Council within two weeks of Augustdetermine the composition of the General Secretariat, which would be acceptable for the Provisional Government. Symptomatic look of confusion andresignation of the chief of the General Secretariat that fond of politicalgame and would not take responsibility for the development of inter-party struggle.</p>
<p>All these events show that the late summer of the previous revolutionary gains almost nothing left, and compromise with the Central Council Provisional Government became increasingly odnobokosti.</p>
<p>Weakening of the Central Council took place against the backdrop of increasesocial tensions, increasing destruction and arbitrary bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Economic and social situation of the population of the Ukrainian lands washard. In fact, the authorities of the Central Council and the General Secretariat notspread outside Kyiv. Paralysis gripped the industrialproduction. Taxes not paid. The bourgeoisie has resorted to sabotage,stopping factories, throwing thousands out into the streetworkers. In early autumn in the Donbass mines did not work 200. Pricescommodities of daily consumption continuously increased. Food supplies werelittle. Provisional Government, as stated by V. Vynnychenko &quot;vyhribav all he could to Ukraine and so limited his food policy. &quot;Ghost hungerapproaching the town and village workers.</p>
<p>This led to the aggravation of social conflicts. Strikesworkers actually never stopped, moving from one branchproduction to another. Sometimes they were accompanied by the establishment of working control now, exile administration, fulldisorganization of the producers of the process. In July-October 1917, in Ukraine188 strikes took place.</p> 
<p>Farmers too were tired of war, economic dislocation,annoyed by the actions of fugitives from the army, suffered from a shortage of arable land andprices of manufactured goods. Some of them resort to desperatealcohol, seeking oblivion in it and play. In all villages multiplied in an enormous homemade vodka factory that produced &quot;hooch.&quot;Hundreds of thousands of pounds of expensive bread without regret processed on alcoholdrinks. Cases landlord estates pogroms and violence againsttheir owners. Landlords with their families fleeing the city.</p>

<p>Increase social and economic crisis in the Russian Empireaccompanied by the further polarization of socio-political movement.His left wing was represented by radical-revolutionary forces who soughtdevelop a revolutionary process further.</p>

<p class="select"><strong>Radicalism</strong> (From Lat.<strong>radix</strong>- Root) - political and ideological trend, which advocates the needdecisive action and deep fundamental changes in political andSocio-economic System.<br>
<strong>Radical</strong> - Strong, fundamentally.</p>

<p>The right wing represented dominant populations, whichIncreasing tried to stabilize the crisis of Provisional Government. Onewith its representatives, General L. Kornilov began to prepare a revolt thatthen called &quot;kornilovskym.</p>
<p>August 26 (September 7) L. Cornelius attempted to seize power,giving orders to troops capture Petrograd. CommandersSouth-Western and Romanian fronts received task setcontrol over the Ukrainian provinces. From the Provisional Government of L. Corneliusrequired to give him all power in the state.</p>
<p>Ukrainian policy is well understood that the victory kornilovskohoplot mean total collapse of their hopes for autonomy. Therefore, despite the contradictions that existed between certain politicalparties, they united their efforts against the rebels. In citiesstarted to Revolutionary Committee, the Salvation Revolutionand other agencies that coordinated the fight against kornilovschyny.</p>
<p>September 8 (27 August), a committee has been created in Kyiv. Heorders of the rebels were arrested supporters, closedBlack Hundred newspaper Kievlyanin. The Committee sent towards kornilovskymtroops that went to Kyiv, its outreach to soldiers deployed among outreach, and they ultimately refused to follow ordersofficers rebels.</p>
<p>Kharkiv to fight kornilovschynoyu created a revolutionaryCommittee, which declared that no order in the local garrison will not beexecuted without coordination with it. However, the committee formedspecial military unit, who spoke against the station KupyanskTroops of General A. Kaledina, L. Kornilov henchman. Similarlyunfolding struggle against kornilovskoho insurgency in LuhanskGorlovka, Odessa, Sevastopol, Katerynoslav and other cities of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thus, the threat of counter-revolutionary rebellion led to rapidgrowing political activity of Ukrainian population. It actedunited front for the preservation of revolutionary democratic gains.</p>
<p>Devastation kornilovschyny added commitment to political parties. Specialactivity differed Bolsheviks. His influence in the councils and in the army theyused to form groups of Red. In spring theyhad to Ukraine by 15 thousand soldiers and Red Guards, usingpopulist slogans began to be serious competition for CentralCouncil.</p>

<p class="select"><strong>Populism</strong> (From Lat. <strong>рopulus</strong>- People) - attempts by some political parties or movements to gainpolitical authority unrealizable promises, flirting with people.Populist slogans have always focused on grassroots support,dissatisfied with the current situation.</p>

<p>This prompted criticism of the UCR deploy actions of the Provisional Government, was not originally in explicitly, through counsel nationwide peasant deputieswent to the Central Council. In early September, duringthe second session of this body, MPs demanded that the ProvisionalGovernment distribution of power in the General Secretariat of all ethnicUkrainian territory, calling the Central Council of &quot;expression of interest andwill of the Ukrainian democracy. &quot;</p>
<p>As the opportunity for direct criticism of the Provisional Government of the Central Council began preparations for use in Petrograd &quot;Democraticmeeting, which was to stabilize the internal situation in Russia and to raisepower of authority. Central Council has launched the preparation of the orderits delegates to this meeting. Discussions took place in the messageheated debate. It strongly criticized the Ukrainian governmentSocial Democrats Porsh M. and M. Tkachenko. They proved false principlesformation of the Provisional Government, proposed re-elect its composition,demanded that the central government exercise full autonomy of Ukraine.</p>
<p>14 (27) September &quot;Democratic Conference&quot; began its work inPetrograd, with the aim to raise the authority of the Provisional Government,blown up in the fight against kornilovschyny. But instead, shedemonstrated a lack of unity among Russian democrats withquestion of power. The meeting decided to form a permanent bodyauthority - the Transitional Council of the Russian Republic (preparliaments), whichplanned to allocate to the these problems.</p>
<p>The Central Council decided to use the platform &quot;Democratic Conference&quot; requirements for the promulgation of Ukraine, which it previously did not dare:&quot;The transfer of all land of the monastery and church landsland management committees, the introduction of state control andedge over production and distribution, taxation of largecapital and property and the confiscation of war profits in favor of someedges and the whole country; appointment decisive steps to making peace;convocation of the Constituent Assembly at the appointed time and without delay &quot;.</p>
<p>However, among the requirements of the Central Council and remained traditional, withwhich it is performed in earlier times: &quot;The transfer of full powerin Ukraine in the hands of the Ukrainian Central Rada, the GeneralSecretariat; purpose of all nations the right to is not limitedself-determination, calling on every nation and land, in order to achievenational boundary sovereign Constituent Assembly, and others.</p>
<p>At the meeting the delegation of the Central Council took the left position, which wasessentially close to the Bolsheviks. Because of this, constantly pressured the Bureau Ukrainian office, limiting his appearances while delegatesCommenting on remarks speakers and more. This attitude to the Bureaupassed on to Ukrainian and other Russian delegates. They arrangedCentral Council representatives present obstruction, interrupting theircries, slam on the table, demonstrative exit from the hallmeetings.</p>
<p>In addition, in the Russian press has been rolled frankanti-Ukrainian company. Petrohrad newspaper &quot;Living Word&quot; publishedarticle with &quot;sensational&quot; report, that within the Central Councilis like a dozen officers of the Austrian and Germanof staff to help Ukrainian &quot;samovyznachytys.</p>
<p>Thus, after the &quot;Democratic Conference&quot; Central Council finallylost hope not only to obtain autonomy from the Provisional Government, butfrom future National Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>Complications of the political situation has pushed the Central Council for more decisive action in the fight for national interests of Ukraine. On her initiative in Kiev, 21-28 August (8-15) in September 1917, a congress of nationsRussia. Central Leadership Council took the initiative to becomecoordinating center for people who wanted to autonomy andfederal restructuring of Russia. At the congress delegates arrived in 1993,representing Ukrainian, Belarusians, Moldovans, Poles, Jews,Crimean Tatars, Bashkir, Georgians, the Caucasian highlanders, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, Don Cossacks, and others. Representatives of the Russian nationCongress was not. This testified to the fact that the Russian ruling eliteremain in positions of centralization and domination over Russificationother peoples of Russia. The main ruling Congress on the federalRussian state system, &quot;stated that Russia is centralizedstate should be transformed into a federation.</p>
<p>UCR late September announced to extend its jurisdictionwhole territory of Dnieper Ukraine and to all spheres of life. This decision caused a new wave of discontent from Russia. The relationship between UCR and Provisional Government continued to escalate.</p>
