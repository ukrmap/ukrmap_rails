<p>July 19 (1 August) in 1914 sparked the First World War. It was logical outcome of economic and political crisis that engulfed much number of countries. With its state interests shared by twoopposing blocs: the Triple Entente and the Union. Because of its geopoliticalUkraine situation will inevitably become a zone of interests of warring parties.Producing only on Russian territory over 1 billion pounds (about 16 million tons) of bread and having vast human resources that couldused for military purposes, Ukraine had a magical attractive force forall belligerent forces in the region - from the Austrian and GermanGovernment to the Russian Bolsheviks. Thus the interests of their own Ukrainian population in general were not considered. As Franko said: &quot;... onUkrainian board policy of Europe is not even worthless pawn.</p>
<p>The main player in the field of that war - Germany - before the warspread the idea that the Ukrainian and other Eastern European nations can notcreate their own state, and so is the historical mission of Germansabsorption and development of these lands. Ukrainian lands was seen in* Germany&#39;s geopolitical plans as a bridgehead for penetration into the East.</p>

</em></p><br>
	
<p>From the beginning, fighting in the summer of 1914 and some Western TerritoryCentral part of Ukraine became one of the major theaters of wareastern Europe. It came together with the two less powerful allies old enemies - Austria-Hungary and Germany on the one hand, andRussia, on the other. Until early 1918 he held the front lineUkrainian territory. Most land Dnieper Ukraine, aspryfrontova zone, were under the jurisdiction of the Kiev militaryDistrict.</p>
<p>Military confrontation between the two countries, accompanied by mass repressionagainst Ukrainian, split in half and nationally conscious PatriotsUkraine on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>When the war before the Ukrainian community faced a painful question: to whomtarget. All the warring countries consistently vtokmachuvaly in your headsubjects the thesis of the need to protect their homeland. Nobody wanted be the aggressor. Russia declared war on national. The main steelslogans: help Slavic brothers and civil peace. AcrossEmpire ruled oboronstva views. Had to determine theattitudes to war and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>In the early days after the declaration of war in the Russian Empire wentpatriotic movement. It has spread and the Ukrainian lands, which wereof it. Many workers and students took part in patriotic manifestation, voluntarily sent to the mobilization points.Most of the farmers Dnieper Ukraine welcomed the outbreak of war asGerman-Austrian aggression: attacked &quot;enemy&quot;, &quot;Teuton&quot;, we must fight.</p>
<p>Political forces Naddniprianshchyna the first days of the war called on Ukrainian to protect the Russian state within which they are used. OnRussia&#39;s support was made leader of the Ukrainian Social Democrats, Petliura.He has published in a Moscow magazine &quot;Ukrainian life&quot; article, whereRussia called on nations to fulfill their civic duty tostate that will allow them to rely on future&quot;Corresponding law&quot;. Kyiv newspaper &quot;Board&quot; wrote that Ukrainian shoulddefend the Russian state.</p>
<p>From the position of Russian patriotism were also immigrants -Muscophiles who moved from the war with the Westland to Kyiv. They created &quot;Carpatho-Ruthenian Liberation Committee&quot; andthrough it turned to Ukrainian Galicia, so that they metRussian army moves godparents is necessary and welcomed bells in churches. Committee issued a brochure in Russian Contemporary Galicia, it handedimperial army officers who were sent to the Galician front, so theycould distinguish Ukrainophiles (Mazepas) from Muscophiles (&quot;Rus&quot;).</p>
<p>However, Russian authorities are carefully treated Ukrainian politicalforces and social movements. In particular, she carefully watched over the &quot;Society of Ukrainian progressives&quot; (TUP), which at the beginning of the waradopted a resolution which recommended that the Ukrainian intelligentsiaobserve neutrality. Many leaders were put under the TUPpolice supervision, and Hrushevsky even arrested on suspicion ofespionage.</p>
<p>Thus, the Ukrainian community in the vast majority were onWorld War I under the influence of patriotic virnopiddanskoyiwaves, hoping that this position will expand their national rights infuture. In fact, war has strengthened the contradictions among the Ukrainian and becamefor their brother.</p>
