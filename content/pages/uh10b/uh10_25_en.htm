publications. Newspapers and magazines were published in Russian and Ukrainian languages.
The total number of printed propaganda in 1920 production
exceeded 18.5 million. The &quot;bourgeois&quot; newspaper
closed.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks sought to put the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; under control,
converting them into an instrument of communist education. However rebuild

destruction. During the Civil War the Bolsheviks created their own system
