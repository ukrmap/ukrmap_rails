<p>It is clear that the percentage of literate people was different in differentprovinces. In 1910 in Ukraine the level of literacy of the population was below average for the entire European part of Russian Empire index - 30%.</p>

<p>Something was in better shape education in Western Ukraineespecially in Galicia. During law school here there were two types of schools:lower - and higher rural - urban. U1900, in eastern Galicia4250 classes worked with the Polish language of instruction, 2250 - Ukrainianlanguage. At the same time from 6240 villages in Galicia in 981 villages had noschools. Secondary schools throughout Galicia there were 49, and only fourof these studies was conducted in Ukrainian.</p>
<p>On the eve of the First World War in Galicia there were already 3500Ukrainian elementary schools where teaching was conducted in their native language.

<p>In Bukovina worked in 1900, six middle schools and noUkrainian language. In 1913 the 13 public and privateschools, only 2 were Ukrainian and 2 - in German and Ukrainianlanguage learning. In South Bukovina there were 305 primary schools.The worst situation was in our region. In all four secondaryeducation institutions was only in Hungarian. InWestern Ukraine, there were 4 higher education institutions, of which 3 in Lviv (University, Polytechnic Institute and Academy of Veterinarymedicine for the Polish studies) and University of Euro - withGerman language.</p>
<p>Thus, throughout the territory of Ukraine there was no universityestablishment of Ukrainian language teaching, no Ukrainian schools thatwas to be supported by the state.
