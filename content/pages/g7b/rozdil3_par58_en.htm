In this &quot;engaged&quot; all its components -rocks, water, air, soil, vegetation and fauna. Fromnatural conditions closely related to our life and health, especiallylife and economic activity.

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU">Mineral resources</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU"> - Are different in origin usefulresources. Many materials for our homes, cars, household items, andmodern life benefits we receive from the bowels of the planet. Oil, natural gas, coalused as fuel for thermal power productionelectricity. These same minerals are the raw materials for chemical industrywhich pererabatyvaya them gets plastics, synthetic fibers, fertilizers and otherproducts. Iron and manganese ore - the raw material for future metal (iron andsteel), which smelted iron industry. A non-ferrous metals from ore(Aluminum, copper, tin, lead, zinc, etc.). Smeltedaluminum, copper, tin, lead, zinc and other metals that are widelyused in mechanical engineering. Non-metallic minerals (sand, clay,schebinka, salt, gypsum, asbestos, etc.) are widely used as buildingmaterials and as raw material for chemical, glass, porcelain and faience, and otherindustries. Currently, the recycling business launched to almost all known substances,that make up Earth&#39;s crust. </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="">Thus, withoutmineral resources can not be a modern human economic activity. However,increasingly large volumes of mineral resources related toexhaustion. Mineral reserves have their limits and are irreparable. </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">LandResources</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> - Aspace needed for life and work of the population. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU">About 1 / 3 of all land occupied landused in agriculture - arable lands, gardens, meadows, pastures.They provide human food. In other territoriessettle career, industrial enterprises, and how cities and villages. Thatland for human resources is vital. But now the planet hasplace of soil depletion, which significantly reduces crop yield.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU">Water resources</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU"> - Is first of all fresh water reserves, whichconcentrated in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and underground. For all kinds of naturalresources most people use the water. A lot (70%) goes toirrigation fields. A huge amount of water used in industry forcooling turbine power plants, furnaces, where smelted iron and steel, whilemanufacture of paper and others. And increasing water consumption for domestic purposespopulation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU">The total stock of fresh water that is available on ourplanet is big enough. However, they are distributed very unevenly. Soon Earth there are many places (drylands <i style="">AfricaAustralia, America, Asia</i>), Where people suffer from lack of fresh water.In addition, due to excessive water intake and water becomes scarce in areas whereMore recently it was enough. </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU">Climatic Resources</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;" lang="RU"> include solar energy, moisture and energywind. They should be taken into account in agriculture. Alreadyknow that the climate depends on cultivation of certain plants. Wherethe climate (warm and wet enough), get two and even threecrop year. In some areas of the globeclimatic conditions with comfortable temperatures and humidity are favorablefor treatment and rest people.</span></p>

The huge role played by forestshave long given individual timber, medicinal plants, mushrooms, berries, nuts. Foreconomic activity is particularly important is wood. It is hard to call thisindustries, wherever used, and whether other productsmade of it. However, this value is not limited forests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Woods called the &quot;lungs&quot; planets, because theyprovide an atmosphere of oxygen. Green areas and carry out soilwater protection role, keep the animal world. Trees clean the air of citiesdust and harmful gases. Forests have a health and aesthetic properties. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Today, forests covered about 1 / 3 of the land surface. Butarea under them in all continents steadily decreasing. Thus, equatorial forestsin Africa, South America and Asia, destroyed almost half. This results notonly to the catastrophic reduction of some species, but also todisappearance of animals that lose their usual living conditions. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Destruction of natural vegetation in the plains and savannasdue to excessive grazing cattle and cutting of trees and a fewshrubs has led to another problem. Deserts, which areintegral part of the nature of continents in recent years seems to rebel, livedand went beyond their limits. You already know that tens of kilometers further southadvanced <i style="">Sahara</i> in Africa. And therewhere cattle grazed not long ago and engaged in agriculture, now dominated sands. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Of all Earth&#39;s resources are inexhaustible and the only waterclimate. Mineral, land (soil) and biological resources belong tocomprehensive, so they are reduced by use.
