<p>Natural resources and environment. Heavy human impact on natureassociated primarily with the need for natural resources. Naturalresources - are components and the forces of nature that at a certain level of developmentproductive forces and the degree of investigation are or may beused in agriculture.</p>
<p>XXI century with its scientific and technical achievements not released person from having to remove significant amounts of natural resources.On the contrary, modern production requires a greater number anddiversity of natural resources than ever before.</p>
<p>First, natural resources - a source of energy, which is crucial imagine the modern world (fuel minerals, hydropower, nuclearfuel, solar power, wind, tidal). Natural resources - the means anditems of work people (land land, water transport routes, water for irrigation and industrial purposes), raw materials for the production(Raw materials, forest resources, process water, atmosphericair). A person can not do without water, vegetable productsfishing, food, vegetable and animal origin.</p>
<p>There are different classifications of natural resources: origin, way of economic use, the degree of completeness.</p>
<p>By origin or relation to a shell of the earth emitsuch natural resources: lithospheric (mineral, land, internalEarth energy), atmospheric (solar power, wind power,agro-climatic) hidrosferni (fresh water, water, oceans);biosphere (animal, plant) natural resources.</p>
<p>By way of economic use of resources can be divided into:production (industrial, agricultural) and non-productive. Toindustrial production resources traditionally include variousfuel and energy resources and various kinds of industrial raw materials, water,land and biological resources. Agricultural consider soilagro-climatic and natural resources. Resource areas are non-recreational resources, in particular - picturesque landscapes, favorableclimatic conditions, curative mud and mineral springs.</p>
<p>There is also direct the use of resources are withdrawn from the environment (herbs, berries, mushrooms).</p>
<p>All natural resources by the degree of completeness is divided into exhaustive and inexhaustible. Number of renewable resources decreases with removal from theirgeographical environment. Comprehensive resources for self-healing ability divided into: renewable and irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Renewable resources can be recovered under certain conditions. Theseresources include biological resources and soil. Fish, forest resources, Industrial animals can recover its number providedrestrict their use by man. But this is only possiblefailure to achieve &quot;critical point&quot; at which self without helpunreal man. In this connection, allocate specific genetic resourceshereditary information is contained in the genetic code of living things. As a result of rampant and worsening living conditionsmany species of living creatures have disappeared or are endangered.</p>
<p>Nonrenewable natural resources are mineral resources. Theyformed over a long geological development of the Earth and undercontinued use can not be restored. Annually from the earth&#39;s interior produce over 100 billion tons of various minerals and fuel. Only 1,5-2% is converted to final product. These resources shouldused efficiently, economically and, if possible, again.</p> 
<p>Inexhaustible natural resources referred to those that are not reduced under their use. This climatic resources (solar, wind,inflow, outflow). They are not consumed directly in economicactivities do not destroy, but in the process they can usedeteriorate. In the recent past to the inexhaustible zarahovuvalyair and water. However, increasing anthropogenic impactencouraged to refer them to a comprehensive, though renewable resources.</p>
<p>Natural conditions - the combination of different components of geographicalenvironment, which have influence on the man and hiseconomic activity.</p>
<p>Resursozabezpechenist. Describing the natural resources and evaluatingpossibilities of economic use, taking into account not onlyabsolute but relative and qualitative. For the quality ofinclude the contents of useful component in the raw materials (eg metalred), presence of impurities (eg, sulfur in coal). Relativeindicators show resursozabezpechenist. Resursozabezpechenist -ratio between the size of natural resources and theiruse.</p>
<p>Resursozabezpechenist expressed as the number of years, which hasenough resources, or its reserves per capita, unitterritory. For example, world oil production in modern conditionslast for 50 years, while in Saudi Arabia have enough reserves140 years and in the USA - 10. Size of proven coal reservesWorld per capita is 210 tons, while in China - 90 tonnesUK - 1500 tons</p> 
<p>Resursozabezpechenist determined by natural factors - stocksresource in a particular area and socio-economic - valueproduction and consumption.</p>
<p>Natural resources are located on the globe is very uneven and thatdifference is caused by conditions of their formation. Consequently, some regionscountries differ resursozabezpechenistyu certain types of resources. ToStates that have all types of known resources include the U.S., Russia,China.</p>
<p>Earth&#39;s growing population, expansion ofeconomic impact on the environment placed on the agenda problem keeping balance in the system&quot;Society-nature&quot;.</p>
<p>Use of natural resources and measures for their conservationare called natural resources. According to rational nature environment is not exposed to the catastrophic impact of productionhuman activity, is in a state of ecological balance, ieprovided his full recovery, and natural resourcesused comprehensively, waste - discarded. For irrationalnatural environment every yeardeteriorates, leading to local, regional andglobal environmental problems.</p>
<p>Ideally, the coexistence of man and nature should be harmonious andexclusively rational nature. However, in most countriesNature is not rational, leading to depletionresources, environmental pollution. Therefore, mankind shouldreflect on the unique natural beauties in national parksand national parks, the introduction of complex technologiesuse of raw materials, processing and subsequent disposal of wasteconstruction of treatment facilities, use of technology closedWater industry, developing new, environmentallyfriendly fuels. A rational approach even with intensive use of natural resources will preserve the natural and anthropogeniccomplexes.</p>
