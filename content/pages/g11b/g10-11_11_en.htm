<p><strong>Geographical environment.</strong></p>
 <p>Throughout history, mankind actively mastered Geographicshell, and used vydozminyuvalo nature, creating an environment his residence - <strong>geographical environment. Geo-environment</strong>- Part of geographic shell, which directly interactnature and man. Geographical environment - a prerequisite forof society, a source of basic resources. Its developmentbecomes more intense due to the development of science, engineering and technology.Current level of development of productive forces allowed a person to learn more of the earth&#39;s surface, deep in the bowels ponyknuty and closestspace. More than 70% of the Earth under the influence of customizedcommercial activity. Instead of natural landscapes comeanthropogenic. This agricultural fields, gardens, cultivated meadowsforests planted by man, reservoirs, quarries, industrial dumps,piles, industrial landscapes and settlements, etc..</p>
