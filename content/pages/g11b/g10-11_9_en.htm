Of all the regions outnumberedmale population, most evident in Asia, particularlyChina and India as well as in several Muslim countries, the leadersamong which are UAE, Kuwait, Qatar. This is due to high mortality among women caused by social inequality of women in society, early marriages, many children, demographic and migration characteristicspolicy.</p>
<p>For most developed countries is characterized by predominance of femalepopulation. The largest proportion of women (up to 54%) in Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine,Russia and Belarus.</p>

There are three age groups: <strong>Children</strong> (Age 15) <strong>serviceable, or adults</strong> (15-65 years), and <strong>elderly </strong>(Over 65 years). In general, the number of children the world is 31% of able-bodied - 62,2%, the elderly - 6,8%. In developing countries, withSecond type of population reproduction - enlarged, there is greatproportion of children (35-40%) and very small portion of the elderly (5-10%). In developed nations are working-age population (60%) and men Senior (18-20%), due to simple or even diminishedreproduction of the population (and reproduction). <p align="center">

<p><strong>Multiethnic state</strong> - The presence of two or morehabitats of indigenous ethnic groups with quantitative predominance of one of them (United Spain, China, Russia, etc..) In the absence of a dominantpredominance of one of them (Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Nigeria) orcolonization type of racially mixed population and natives(Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Australia,Canada, New Zealand, USA, etc...)</p>
