<p>EGP and natural resources potential. Germany - a rich, economicallydeveloped state in Central Europe. Bordering the Baltic and the North Sea, bordered to the east of Poland in the south - with Denmark, in the west -Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, on the south - FranceSwitzerland, Austria, Czech Republic. Strait North Sea separates it fromSweden.</p>
<p>By the nature of the surface of the country can be divided into Pvinichnonimetskulowlands, mountains and Serednonimetski Southern Germany. In the southare spurs of the Alps from the top of Zugspitze (2968 m). Northline of average Rhine Shales mountain ranges ThuringianWood, the legendary mountain of the Harz Brokken (1142 m), Teutoburg WoodOre Mountains. In the north is the North lowland hills and lakes. To the south is Lake Constance. The largest river Rhinetributaries of the Main, Mosel, Ems, Weser, Elbe, Oder, Danube.

The main mineralNatural resources: coal, lignite, small reserves of oil, natural gas,iron, copper, nickel, uranium ore, potash, salt. Has sufficientnumber of processed timber and land. Overallgeographical conditions of the country can be considered quite satisfactory fordevelopment of their agriculture and economy.</p>
<p><strong>Population</strong>. More than 95% of the population isGermans, but also living Italians, Poles, Greeks, Czechs, Croats,Slovaks, Turks. The average population density in the country is large enough -230.8 people. per km2. Most of them are Catholics (mainly living insouthern lands), about 40% - Lutherans (the north).

<p>Like other European countries, Germany had a large population losses duringWorld War II, but a successful process of &quot;repatriation&quot;ethnic Germans as well as immigration economically active populationTurkey, Italy, Greece allowed to quickly restore the number ofpopulation.</p>
<p>The government initiated economic reform measures, among them - graduallyincrease the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67 years. The government of the countrywas forced to resort to this step because the overall aging processpopulation.

<p>Cities West Germany have a long (more than 2000 years) history, because They were founded in times of Roman Empire (Cologne - 37 g.BC, Aachen - and art. BC). Average German town - a small and quiet, with colorful &quot;gingerbread&quot; houses and clean streets. In eachThey keep their own culture, but nationwide, celebratedlocal land holiday, held festivals, carnivals.

<p>There are no clearly expressed economic and political center. Rhine-Ruhr area with its major cities <strong>Dusseldorf</strong>, <strong>Cologne</strong>, <strong>Dortmund</strong>, <strong>Essen</strong>, <strong>Duisburg</strong>is the main industrial core of the country. Major financial centers andone of the largest banking centers in Europe is Frankfurt am Main.There are over 420 German and international financialcompanies and banks, in 1998 he placed the European Centralbank.</p>
<p>Germany has always been famous for highly educated population and itsquality. In 1348 was founded the first German university in Praguethen - Universities in Heidelberg (1386) and Cologne (1388). Todayknown in the world universities of Munich, Berlin, Bonn, Hamburg, Munster. Germany gave the world a galaxy of outstanding scientists, artists,Writers: Martin Behayma, Alexander von Humboldt, WilhelmRoentgen, George Ohm, Max Planck Hrymm brothers, Heinrich Heine, ThomasMann, Ludwig Feyhtvanhera, Bertolt Brecht, Johann Sebastian Bach,Georg Handel and others.</p>
<p><strong>Berlin</strong>, The capital of Germany the rights of the land. Citylocated in the eastern part of Germany, surrounded by rivers and lakes,confluence of the River Spree in the river Havel. A major transport hub: networkchannels linking the city with the rivers Elbe and Oder, employs threeinternational airports, subway, urban electrified railwaynetwork. Major industrial center, whose main industry -electrical engineering, electronics, instrumentation, general and transportengineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, printing, light and foodindustry.</p>
<p>In 1700, the city was founded Prussian Academy of Sciences with Leibniz, and in 1810 - Humboldt University.</p>
<p>After the formation of the German Democratic Republic East Berlin was declared its capital (1949). Economic problems and politicalinstability after the death of Stalin brought in mid-June 1953 to sharp worsening political crisis, there was a final split of the city.For the first time in 1952 the GDR authorities had taken stringent measures: closedstreets of East Berlin in the West, disconnected phone lines,barred for residents of West Berlin to enter the territory GDR. After closing the borders of Berlin remained the only city whereyou can almost freely move to the west. What&#39;s happened is notlittle precedent in history - a radical separation of the huge citypopulation of over 3 million people and total isolation of one part ofanother. August 13, 1961 along the borders between sectors have been builtBerlin Wall. It was finally dismantled in January 1990, and Berlin returned a status of official capital of Germany.</p>

This means that the share of industry in the productionGDP is large enough in comparison with many other developed countries world. Only Japan, Ireland and Portugal are moreindustrialized than Germany. It is no coincidence, since specializationGermany in the global economy is the production of industrial products,mainly engineering products.</p>
