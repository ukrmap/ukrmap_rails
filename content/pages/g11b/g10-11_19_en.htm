<p><strong>Transport and communications</strong> - Important areas of the world
economy. Making cargo, passengers, transfer
information in space, they provide the market exchange of goods and
services between countries and regions, participate in shaping their
economic specialization, contribute to the deepening of processes of cooperation
production. Transportation and communication form the only regional,
national and world markets. These two branches are called &quot;circulatory
the system &quot;world economy. The role of these industries are so large that
the level of their development to determine the level of development.</p>
<p>During the Age of Discovery (XV-XVI centuries.) Big role in
forming a single world market has played a maritime transport. Only
he could dopravyty goods from one continent to another.
However, the &quot;golden age&quot; of transport it is only on the verge of XVIII-XIX. When
 began development of capitalist relations. In capitalist
method of production of products made exclusively for sale. Over time
objectively deepening production specialization between different regions
and countries, followed by activation of a commodity exchange
between them. Along with that the search for cheaper raw materials and labor
forces, not necessarily in their country. All this contributes to the development
transport. There are new types of him: road and rail -
late eighteenth - early nineteenth century., pipeline - the late nineteenth
Art., aviation - the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>At the same time is gradual replacement of old types of engines for new
 effective. Instead of sailing and sea-river vessels after
invention of the steam engine came to Ferry (initially
wheel, then screw), they changed the boat from the diesel engine.
Steam carriage (1789) changed the first car with gas and then with
Gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine.
Parotyahy railroad gradually been replaced by diesel locomotives (diesel
engine) and electric locomotives, and aircraft turbine - turbojet.</p>

<p>An absolute leader in the length of road is the road
 transport (28 000 thousand km), due to its availability and relatively
low cost. Sea transport is the second (10 500 thousand km)
 thanks to huge spaces of the oceans and activation during
past few decades, sea intercontinental traffic.</p>

<p>Because of the technological features of the construction, character
loads and natural features of different regions in each of them
is a leading one type of transport. For example, in most
developed countries and many developing countries (primarily
Latin America) as the main mode of transportation - automobile. In Russia,
China, India traditionally advantage for rail, and countries
Southwest Asia extraordinarily rich in oil and gas
 - Pipeline. In Japan, Greece, Indonesia, Philippines, Chile, even in
 domestic transportation leader is sea transport.</p>
<p>One of the main modes of transport is the railway. Today, the most
rail network are countries with large areas - the U.S., Russia, China,
India. About 30 countries do not have railways (Guinea,
Nigeria, Burundi, Somalia, Chad, Rwanda, Lesotho, Guinea-Bissau
Equatorial Guinea). The maximum density of railways are Belgium,
Switzerland (200 km / 1000 km2), Germany and other European
country. For the length of electrified railways in the world&#39;s leading Russia
Germany, France, India, China. Share of electrified lines in most
 countries with mountainous terrain, because the electric locomotive would be better to go
up and down. In Russia it is 47%, in Ukraine - 40%, and the U.S. - 1

Ukraine, Germany, Poland, France, Japan, Italy.</p>
<p>With passenger figures emit India, Japan, China, where
travel by rail is traditionally cheap and convenient and therefore popular.</p>
<p>Among the latest trends in international rail transport -
 creation of highways for passenger and mail
transportation. Compared to such an extensive network of trails already built in
Japan (Shinkansen), France (TGV), Germany (&quot;Inter Continental&quot;
&quot;Inter City&quot;), the U.S. and Spain. Record speed of trains on those routes -

<p>For the curious. The first railway in the world of steam locomotives on
traction was built in 1825 in the UK (area
Stockton - Darlington), and in 1930 the first commercial passenger
train plied between Liverpool and Manchester. In the mid-nineteenth century.
railroad appeared in France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Russia,
Netherlands, Italy, Spain, India, Egypt, Australia, Brazil,
Argentina. In 1913, the total length of railways was 1 100 thousand km,
 roughly the same as today. Longest
U.S. rail network had (409 thousand sq. km), Russian Empire (72),
Germany (65) United Kingdom (40.8), France (39.6), Italy (34,7).

<p>For the worldwide network of several types of typical railway track. In
European countries, USA, Japan and many developing countries,
extended track width 1435 mm, in Ukraine, Russia, Finland, Mongolia
 - 1 520 mm, in most developing countries - 1667, 1 067, 1 000,
762 mm. Sometimes in one country there are several types of tracks. It
reduces the efficiency of railway operation.</p>
<p>A significant contribution to passenger rail transport makes
Subway. The first subway line appeared in 1863 in London (United
Britain). London subway and most branchy in the world today.
Longest Metro New York (over 450 km and more than 500
stations).</p>

<p>Road transport is not equally developed in different countries. On
today with a total length of highways global leadership
 by the United States, India and Brazil. In recent years a significant number of
highways built in China. Over the length of routes

France, Germany and other developed countries. Lowest security

Rapid construction of motorways of international value and
transcontinental highways.</p>
<p>The development of road transport began earlier than the development
railway. The first way, otmostki stone yet appeared in France in
Sixteenth century. They were called &quot;highway&quot; (literally &quot;shod&quot;), then the word
and entered into other languages. The first way of bituminous concrete pavement
appeared in Europe only in the first half of the nineteenth century. For several
ages all ground transportation routes carried horse carriages.

1914 launched its first radio station in the world &quot;Lokren&quot;

operates in almost all countries.</p>
<p>The first effective electric communication was the telegraph.
Two-way communication through a telephone. Radio made the connection without
networks of wires, for use moving subjects.</p>
<p>Now the media are divided into three major groups -
cable, and satellite radio. Service information can be
broadcasting (radio, television) and general use (phone,
fax, facsimile, e-mail).</p>
