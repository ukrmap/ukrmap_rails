<p>Decisive influence on the world economy over the entire history had <strong>technological progress (NTP)</strong>- Constant dynamic process of improvement of technology and engineering. Timesince there acceleration inside it the appearance of innovations.This period is called science and technology (RTD) - qualitativeleap in technology development and technology. STC revolution leads toQuick update range of products, itsimprovement, growth of modern industry.</p>
<p>Total in its history, humanity has survived three STC. The first coincided ontime with the English Industrial Revolution and was characterized by wideimplementation in all spheres of economic activity steam engine,second was due to replacement of its electric motor, and third -the emergence and active use of computer technology.</p>

<p>Science in the era of NTR forms extensive areas of human activity;scientists in the world - 5-6 million people, ie 9 / 10 scholars everlived on Earth - our contemporaries.</p>
<p>STC has four main components: science, engineering and technology, production and management</p>
<p>World economy is now on the influence of the third (modern)scientific and technological revolution, which has such characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>transformation of science into a leading industrial power of society, increase scientific capacity of production;</li>
    <li>computerization of all spheres of social life, complexautomation and robotics all production processes, use of newstructural materials and new types of energy sources,biotechnology;</li>
    <li>improving technology in the direction of saving resources and environmental protection;</li>
    <li>Go to the new frontiers of research of the oceans and space;</li>
    <li>radical restructuring of industry and territorial production system.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the development of the modern world economy increasingly roleScience, which became a kind of discovery production, locomotivedevelopment of techniques and technologies. It requires significant investments,extensive academic training. A society that cares about itsDevelopment and Welfare, invests heavily in research, modernization of education, training of higher qualification. The proven success in thisfield are Japan, USA, UK, Germany and France.</p>
<p>Potential form of territorial organization of scientific and production complexes were <strong>polis </strong>- deliberately shaped area of activity, which combineinteracting research institutes, universities and science-based industrialenterprise.</p>
<p>Computerization, elektronizatsiya, automation of production processespromotes the redistribution of labor resources by industry sector.Decreasing the number of employed in material production increasesproportion of intangibles in the area - servicingbanking and financial institutions, education, science.</p> 
<p>NTR affects the territorial organization of production, distribution of productive forces. <strong>Extensive</strong> path of economic development through development of new lands, construction of new enterprises, replacing <strong>intense</strong>Which provides high-quality renovation of existing enterprises, new approaches to the use of existing areas.</p>
<p>Changing role of factors that influence the allocation of production.</p>
<ol start="1">
	<li>territorial (the bigger the territory, the more options for placement of production);</li>
    <li>economic and geographical location (EHP may be advantageous, notconvenient, central, neighborly, seaside, targeting importedraw materials and fuel, recovery of world trade does benefitseaside location);</li>
    <li>natural resources (determines placement of primary industriesproduction is now losing its influence in the allocation of processingindustry);</li>
    <li>transport (promotes sharing of resources, goods, movement of population; now through modernization of vehicles in the era of STC makesjustified transportation on long distances);</li>
    <li>labor resource (skilled workforce in developed countries contributethe place is &quot;top&quot; tier manufacturing industry, which is the mostrequire high technology and qualified personnel; cheap laborSoutheast Asia represents itself attracts manufacturing from developedcountries);</li>
    <li>concentration (merging firms contribute to intensify the process of urbanization, the formation of urban agglomerations);</li>
    <li>scientific capacity (a new factor that contributes to the production of gravitationsignificant scientific, educational centers, the creation of cities - research centers);</li>
    <li>Environment (necessarily its account when upgradingexisting businesses, locating new, &quot;dirty&quot; production is increasingly submitted in the less industrialized and urbanized regions,legislation in many countries rigid sanctions forpollution).</li>

<p>World economy is in constant evolution.</p>

<p>The primary sector considered such that as close to natureand does not require high educational level and qualifications.Secondary field of primary production processes, proposing higherrequirements for skills and intellectual abilities of staff. Tertiary &quot;Builds&quot; on primary and secondary, as each servesthem. Workers employed in it must have friendly,pryvitlyvistyu, helpfulness, combined with speed and accuracy.Quaternary &quot;grows&quot; with tertiary and maintains close ties withprimary and secondary. An employee in this area has a higher education and the highestqualification. P&#39;yaterynna field completes the range of manyvarious types of business. Its mission - to ensure continuity, the most effective and balanced work of othersareas. Employees engaged in the tertiary sector, called &quot;bluecollar workers in the Quaternary - &quot;white&quot; in pyaterynniy - &quot;gold&quot;.</p>
<p>For a modern industrial structure of the global economy is characterizedthe relationship between different sectors and spheres of economicactivity. In agriculture produced 1 / 20 valueworld gross product (AMS), and it employs about? WorldEAH. The share of industry in the AIST is 1 / 3, and EAH - 1 / 5 share sectorService - under 3 / 5 and 1 / 3. So, in the modern economy DominatingAEP share made in the service sector because its products are mostexpensive. Thus most of the labor force is concentrated in agriculture economy, because of the prevalence of type Agricultural Economicslarge number of developing countries.</p>
<p>The distribution of particles between these sectors and areas in different groups of countriesthe world is different. In the countries of the Centre in the GDP prevails share of services that meets the post-industrial stage of developmenttheir economies. In countries Napivperyferiyi in the GDP and the share of EAHservice below, with the industry in the GDP more than 3 times greater than agriculture, and in the structure EAH -behind him. This is a high level ofindustry compared with agriculture, is responsibleindustrial stage of development. In countries Peripheries share of servicesrelatively small industry in the GDP is not much higher thanagriculture, and in the structure of the ESA - is after him in 2,5 times. These characteristics are caused by low levels of economic development of thesecountries with a clear predominance in their agricultural sectors thatcorresponds to pre-industrial stage of development.</p> 
<p>Therefore, all national economies in industrial structure can bedivided into three types: pre-industrial, industrial;postindustrial.</p>
<p>In the sectoral structure of world industrial production leadsEngineering (part 1 / 3), in second place - the chemical industry,third food reserves. However, in more developed countrieshigh proportion of engineering and industries that producehigh degree of processing, and a small percentage of mining, light andfood industry. In developing countries, the share of miningslightly less manufacturing industry. Within the last parityretain engineering, food and chemical industries.</p> 
<p><strong>The territorial structure of world economy</strong> - Aaccommodation sectors of the economy of countries, regions, continents.Important parameters that characterize the country&#39;s place in worldthe economy is gross domestic product (GDP) and gross nationalproduct (GDP), GDP per capita, number of economically active population, the rate of specialization. According to these indexes andmeans for the role and place in the world economy, countries in differentiating three groups: the &quot;Center&quot;, &quot;Napivperyferiyu&quot;, &quot;periphery&quot;. In the countries of the CentreWorld Economy GDP per capita exceeds $ 10 000. per year, Napivperyferiyi countries ranges from 500 to 10 000 dol.na year, andPeripheries countries less than 500 dollars. The countries &quot;Center&quot; are almost all wealthy developed countries and developing countries - Financesurplus countries - exporters of oil. Napivperyferiyu form the country average level of development. This is the most numerous group, comprisingincludes most developing countries, a second-socialist countries.Peripherals represented the poorest countries.</p>
<p>The territorial structure of the world economy developed during thelong period. In the nineteenth century. on all parameters extracted Europe, ie world economy was monocentric character. In the twentieth century. appeared one center of the world economy - the U.S., which soon took the lead position. After the Second World War, large commercial centersare China, Japan, Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, and now - newindustrialized countries (NICs) - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong KongSingapore.</p>
<p>Currently formed polycentric model of world economy following centers: North American, whose core is the U.S. economy witheconomies of Canada, Mexico Yi, European, whose core is the economyEU countries led by Germany, the Asia-Pacific, integrationwhich formed the core of Japan, China, and &quot;Far Eastern tigers.</p>
<p>The process of forming the poles of economic growth continues. The perspective is regions of Northern Eurasia, South America, Australia and NewZealand.</p>
