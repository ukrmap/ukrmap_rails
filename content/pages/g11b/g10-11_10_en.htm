<p><strong>Social structure.</strong></p>
<p>People almost never included in social interactiondirectly. It is always a certain group interests and normsbehavior which influence it. Because society is made up of thesegroups. Therefore, to understand the social processes that occurto analyze society within <strong>social structure</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The social structure of population </strong>- A system differenttypes of communities (class, property, professional, territorial) andstable and orderly relations between them. <strong>Social class</strong>- A large body of people with relatives living standards, values,interests, education, social status. As a rule, produce highermiddle and lower class.</p>
<p>Some researchers define social groups (classes) based on income economic status, profession or occupation, and education. Others include tocertain class, a group of people who themselves are admitted to themregardless of socio-economic indicators which determine theirsocial position.</p>
<p>All men are born equal, regardless of their gender,racial, ethnic characteristics. In the process of coexistence in the socialspace with other individuals, and revealing their samorealizuyuchystalents of individual efforts, according to what benefits it brings to society deserves to move in a more preferredgroup. Social inequality leads to the creation of the &quot;social ladder&quot;, bywhere people are moving up, securing, their children all the bestliving conditions and increasing opportunities, or down where these opportunitiesnarrowed.</p>
<p>Type of social structure reflects the nature of socio-economicsystem of society. For developed countries characterized by socialstructure in which the highest grade of approximately 10-15% of totalpopulation, the middle class - 60-80%, lower class - 15-20%. A certain portion lower class of unemployed, homeless, seasonal workers.Given the size of the middle group and its stabilizing effect onsociety, civilization developed countries (Western civilization) is sometimes more called &quot;the civilization of the middle class.&quot; Signs of the middle classinclude the availability of property as property acquired or existingas a source of income, highly educated, middle income country, professional activity that has a high prestige in society. Interestsmiddle-class dominated society in developed countries opposedesire to further enrich the richest and sweeping compensateencroachment of the poorest to change social structures of society.</p>
<p>For developing countries, characterized by social structuresociety, which accounts for a higher class of 1-3% of totalpopulation average - 5-7% lower - 90%.</p>
<p>In today&#39;s open society, a factor that affectsimprove the human place in society, is education. Having a higher leveleducation, worker raises his professional qualifications, can performmore complex and responsible work, and this gives him reason toreceive higher compensation for the work permit to takepower management solutions, provides the opportunity to usecertain privileges.</p>
