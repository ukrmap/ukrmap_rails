It is not so large (10 million km2), as Asia, is not socompact as Australia, less exotic than Africa, with its lengthnorth to south is much smaller than in America, but its topography, climate, flora and fauna are diverse and quite interesting, and people thatpopulate Europe have a long and interesting history.</p><p>The name of the world comes from Greek mythology. <strong>Europe</strong>- Daughter of King Agenor of Phoenicia was abducted by Zeus, who turnedbull. It pereplyvla sea on the back of the bull and got to the islandCrete.</p><p>In ancient times, Europe was the cradle of many highlyCivilizations: Aegean, Hellenic, Celtic, Roman and more. Itbecame the world&#39;s largest region of the spread of Christianity. In the course ofhistory of the European nations joined the natives of Africa,Asia, bringing with them their religion, customs and traditions. In the pastmost countries in Europe were either large colonial mother countriesempires (Spain, Portugal, Holland, England, France, etc.) or the samewere part of larger empires (Ukraine, Belarus, Bulgaria, Moldovaetc.).

In the northArctic and subarctic climate in the south - the Mediterranean. Herecan be very hot, as in Spain, and can be snow and cold as in Finland. The largest rivers of Europe: Volga, Danube, Dnieper, Don, Pechora, Rhine, Vistula, Elbe, Odra, Rhone, Loire, Tagus, the largest lakes: Ladoga, Onega, Chudskoi, Balaton, Geneva.</p><p>The relief is represented in different forms. Most of the territory has an average height of 300 meters above sea level. However, the mountains Alps, Pyrenees,Carpathians, Apennines, Ural rise to medium altitudes.</p><p>Natural zone change from arctic deserts, tundra, tundra,taiga, mixed and deciduous forests to forest-steppe, steppe,Mediterranean forests and subtropical shrubs and evensemidesert.</p><p>Traditionally, geographers divide in Europe following regions: Western, Central and Eastern Europe:</p><ul>	<li>Western Europe (France, Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Germany and others);</li>    <li>Eastern Europe (up to end 80 years of the twentieth century. Its membership included the socialist countries and the European part of USSR);</li>    <li>Central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and others). </li></ul><p>Modern Europe seeks not to the distribution of parts and toassociation. The most vivid illustration of this commitment -establishment of the Schengen area for more convenient free movement of persons and harmonization of border controls between European countries.</p><p>General characteristics of the population.
