<p><strong>Industry world.</strong></p>
<p> All industries depending on the time of distinguishablethree groups: old industry (coal, iron ore, metallurgical, textile industry, shipbuilding), whose development slowed today, but Geography location change for the benefit of developing countries, new industry (automotive, manufacturing aluminum, plastic, chemicalfiber), which are concentrated mainly in developed countries, as well asdeveloping countries where rapidly growing, new field(Electronics, computing, aerospace and microbiologicalindustry), which are developing fast and steady pace,located in economically developed and the &quot;newly industrialized countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Consider the geography of major industries.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel and energy industry.</strong></p>
<p>Fuel and energy industry includes the mining,processing of fuel (the industry), electricity, its transportation and distribution (electric power). It supplies fueland electricity to all industries, providing the populationwarmth and energy. Fuel and energy complex is inter-branch one fund most capital-intensive and requires a cumbersome and expensiveequipment.</p> 
<p>Modern world scale energy exceed 11 billion tonsconditional fuel (t.u.p) annually. Extraction of mineral fuels andelectricity is growing rapidly. Thus, the twentieth century.produced more fuel than any previous human history.</p>

<p>In the global energy balance of the currently predominant oil (35,8%), followed by coal (25,8%) and gas (27,5%).</p>
<p>Among the regions of the world&#39;s largest energy consumers are Asia, North America and Europe. Among individual countries as the biggest consumerFuel and energy emit mainly developed countries and large countries, developing countries (U.S., China, Russia, Japan, Germany, India, Canada,France, Britain, Italy), and per capita -developed valves (Canada, USA, Australia, Netherlands, France, GreatBritain, Russia, Germany, Japan, Switzerland).</p>

Itled to higher prices for oil and natural gas price which was in3-5 times higher than coal.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel industry</strong> specializing in mining and processing of various fuels - in particular oil, coal, natural gas.</p>
<p><strong>Coal</strong> - Among the oldestenergy industries. During the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century.coal industry was leading. The largest numbercoal mining companies (mainly mines) accounted for the USA, GreatBritain, Germany and the USSR.</p>
<p>In 50-60 years of the twentieth century. coal industry lost the oil, andthen the gas industry. Only a world energy crisis in 1973 Stimulated coal, in particular the open method, which is relatively cheap.</p>
<p>In 70-80 years. Twentieth century. intensified the global coal trade.Countries that significantly exceeded its coal resources (or their output zdorozhchav), have begun to prefer imported resource. In particular,coal output cut Germany, Great Britain, France,Belgium, Japan, began to further increase exports of U.S.Australia, Poland, Indonesia, Colombia.

A policy of discrimination against localblack population, carried out by the government of South Africa, worldCommunity introduced an embargo (ban) on oil imports to the country. Afterlifting of the embargo was aimed surplus coal for export. Coalindustry transition countries - Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan - After the radical market reforms, is in deep crisis thatleads to significant reductions in the volume of coal production.</p>
<p>Coal qualities per share to: <strong>stone</strong> (Among them anthracite - naykaloriynishe) - used as fuel; <strong>coking</strong> - Used in metallurgy; <strong>brown</strong> - Has a high ash content and low calorie.</p>
<p>Coal mined open (career) and closed (mine)ways. Clear the way much cheaper. In mines producinghigh quality coking coal used for coke production.Coal is also used in the chemical industry to produceaniline dyes, medicines.</p> 
<p>Most coal mined in China, USA, India, Germany, Russia,Australia, South Africa. Coal is used mainly in countries where it is mined. On the export goes only 10% of the industry.Major coal exporters are the U.S., South Africa, Australia.Importing coal Japan, Western Europe, Brazil.</p>

<p>Coal mining is causing great harm to the environment. Undermines and waste piles (piles) alienated large territories. During transportation and processing of coal contaminated soilair, water. In areas where coal is difficult to recovervegetation, especially trees, because of impurities that increase the aciditysoils. Hillsides with loose earth easily blur the showers.This area requires complex reclaiming activities.</p>
<p><strong>Oil industry</strong> developed in over 80 countriesworld. Oil accounts for about 35% of all fuelused worldwide. Today, the global oilexceeds 3.5 billion tons per year. There are three ways to produce oil:Christmas tree (possible only for &quot;young&quot; areas) pump (muchexpensive, is used more often), coal (used rarely,for special types of &quot;heavy&quot; crude oil).</p>
<p>Oil - one of the most important commodities on world markets. It is widelyused not only as fuel but also as a valuable chemical raw materials (forplastics, resins, rubber, dyes). Various fields of Oildistinguished by its quality: content of impurities, in particular - sulfur, paraffin, light fraction.</p>

<p>Most of the oil producing countries in Asia - 38% on the secondplace America - 21%. About 40% of world output accounted forOPEC member countries. Especially highlighted the Persian Gulf, withinwhich are 2 / 3 of world&#39;s proven oil reserves and 1 / 3 of itsextraction. The second important area - West-Siberian plain. For stocks Oil takes the first place, Saudi Arabia, the second - Russia. Butcomplex natural conditions in Russia increased value of Russian oil. Onexport is 40-50% of oil produced. The major exporters Oil is the Middle East, Venezuela, Algeria, Libya, Russia. Buy Oil Europe, Japan and USA. Most of the oil transported by oil tankers.</p>
<p>Refineries (refinery) build around for oil,about consumers and oil pipelines. Preferred placement refinery nearconsumers, because crude oil is cheaper thanpetroleum products. Under most of the refinerylocated in developed countries. More than 50 million tons of oil annuallyprocessing refinery in New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Rotterdam.</p>

<p>Significantly slows global oil production established in 1960&quot;Oil cartel - OPEC, which sets quotas (quantitative restrictions)Member States on oil production. This organization tries to regulate volume of oil flowing to world markets, affecting world pricesfor oil.</p>
<p>To maintain the achieved volume and increase oil production isreconnaissance needs in new fields. In the middle of the twentieth century. activelybegan development of the marine shelf. Today the offshore producing about 1 / 4 of world&#39;s oil. Vast areas of offshore production isPersian Gulf (2 / 5 of world marine production), the Gulf of MaracaiboVenezuela (1 / 4 of world marine production), Gulf of Mexico,North Sea (Norway, UK, Denmark), Caspian Sea,Gulf of Guinea (Nigeria), Pivdennokytayske Sea (Thailand, Malaysia,Brunei, Vietnam). Promising future of oil is shelf zone of the NorthernArctic Ocean region Pryantarktychni oceans.</p>
<p>Oil companies usually are the highest among industrialcompanies in the world. Most of their American owned,British, French and Netherlands capital. At the turnXX-XXI century. merged many companies. Among the major oil Companies release a Ekssonmobil &quot;,&quot; Shefron Texaco &quot;,&quot; Conoco Phillips &quot;(USA), British Petroleum-Amok &quot;(USA and UK), RoyalDatch / Shell (UK and Netherlands), &quot;Total Fina Elf (France and Belgium), &quot;eon&quot;, &quot;pit-Dea (Germany), ANNIE (Italy). Substantial depositspetroleum and capital are concentrated in capital companies in developing countries, - Petrobras (Brazil), PEMEX (Mexico), &quot;Petroven (Venezuela).Russia has 5 large companies - Lukoil, TNK, &quot;Surhutnyeftyehaz&quot;&quot;Sibnyeft&quot;, &quot;Yuhansknyeftyehaz. Oil companies and the GulfAfrica are usually family members or monarch undercontrol of the local elite.</p>
<p><strong>Gas industry</strong> developing very fastpace. This is a high heat capacity gas simplicityuse, minimal environmental pollution.</p>
<p>Gas is also an important chemical raw materials. The share of natural gasthe fuel that is extracted, was increased in 60 years of the twentiethArt. Previously unquestioned leader in gas production were the USA, then80 years of almost caught up and then overtook Russia. At the samebecome a rapidly increase the volume of gas production, Canada, Netherlands,Norway, Britain, Algeria, South-East Asia, the Persian Gulf, Latin America and Australia.</p>
<p>Today the first place in the world gas production, Russia is onsecond - the United States. Together these countries produce half of the gasmined in the world. Russia is one of the largest exporters of gas.Pipelines it provides this fuel and powerresource for almost all of Europe. Algeria transports gas in the U.S. and Europe, countriesPersian Gulf, Indonesia and Australia are selling gas in Japan.</p>
<p>Extraction and processing of natural gas is usually concentrated inthe large oil companies (Gazprom (Russia), &quot;British HPS&quot; (United Britain and the U.S.)).</p>
<p>Production of oil and gas may lead to a range of environmentalproblems. Voids that are produced by mining, maycause failures of the soil. They are usually filled with water. Soot thatformed by the accompanying gas, settling on the land surface inhigh latitudes is melting snow, reindeer moss destruction - an importantforage olenyarstva. Accidents on oil pipelines leading tosoil contamination, groundwater. Oil production on the shelf maylead to death of fish, birds and animals.</p>

<p><strong>Metallurgical Industry.</strong></p>
<p>Metallurgical industry produces ferrous and nonferrous metals.Ferrous metals are alloys of iron (iron and various brandssteel), color - the rest of metals and their alloys.</p>
<p>Metals - one of the main structural materials. Foruse a lot of metal components. First, itore (the main raw material), fuel, various support materials. Productionmetal - a complex multistage process. Metallurgy is extremelymaterial and kapitolomistkoyu industry.Since the 90&#39;s century. in developed Western countries almost allsteel made in oxygen converters and furnaces. Viadirect reduction of iron | metallized pellets produced in the world More than 40 million tons of steel.</p>
<p><strong>Steel.</strong></p>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century. iron ore geographicallycoincided with the main areas vyplavlyannya iron and steel and wasconcentrated mainly in developed countries in Europe and North America. Exception of the country in which the iron ore deposits were absentor until exhausted (eg Germany, UK). FromTime was a gradual shift of iron ore in the newregions of the world, especially in developing countries, as wereexplored major new fields and even entire pools of iron ore.Important role in the reorientation of the new steel raw materialsplayed and technical progress of maritime transport, which led to a sharp reduce the cost of transporting ore. Many countries hadsubstantially reduce or entirely stop its own ore mining (UnitedBritain, Germany, France, Spain, USA). Other countries, by contrast,began rapidly to increase the production of iron ore to itsfurther exports (Brazil, Australia).</p>

<p>At the beginning of. largest iron ore mined in China, Brazil and Australia.</p> 
<p>Large regions of the iron ore mining in Brazil was the so-called &quot;Iron triangle&quot; in the state of Minas Gerais and poolSerra dos Karazhas in the state of Para, in Australia - and pools HammersliIntern Dindeyl in the far north west. Rapid development Iron ore industry is experiencing in China and India. China producesore for their own needs, and India - for their own needs and for export.Traditionally, a significant amount of iron ore mined in Sweden and some African countries (South Africa, Mauritania, Liberia). Onworld market gets 1 / 2 ore that is mined, with 4 / 5transported by sea.</p>
<p>The largest ore exporters are Brazil and Australia (40%), IndiaCanada, South Africa, Sweden, Liberia, Chile, Mauritius. Largeimporters - Japan, European countries (Germany, Belgium? LuxembourgFrance, Italy, Britain, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia), USA. Japan receives iron ore from Australia, Brazil, India, South Africa;Germany - from Brazil, Sweden, Canada, United States - from Canada, Liberia,Venezuela.</p>
<p>Leading world producers of coke is China, the USA, someEuropean countries, Ukraine, Russia. Cox usually produced in areasits use.</p>
<p>For the production of quality steel or steel with specified propertieswide push alloyed metals. The most popular metals are doped molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, chromium, nickel, titanium. More than halfmolybdenum ore mined in the U.S., 2 / 5 tungsten ores - in China.World production of manganese ores are concentrated in South AfricaAustralia, Brazil, Gabon, India, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Georgia. Chromite mined in South Africa, Kazakhstan, Iran, Turkey, India,Fiji, Finland, Brazil, Albania, the Philippines.</p>
<p>Production of pig iron and steel mills traditionally full cycletends to fuel and raw materials. Thus, the role of transport andconsumer.</p>
<p>The level of development of ferrous metallurgy in the country can be drawn for the following indicators:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Steel output per capita. World leader inthis index is Luxembourg (2-3 tons, the country is called &quot;steelDuchy &quot;), Belgium (1200 kg), Czech Republic, Slovakia, South Korea (in950 kg), Japan (830 kg); </li>
    <li>ratio of production of iron and steel. Significantprevalence over the volumes of volumes of steel cast iron evidence of highlevel of development of ferrous metallurgy. Especially high-quality steel producedusually from scrap. Therefore, countries do not need to create large-scale iron production, and can handle both domestic and imported scrap.</li>
</ul>
<p>In recent years, a typical trend in developed countriesdevelop small rolling mills. Initial stages of production of iron(&quot;Dirty metals&quot;) superseded in developing countries. With 70twentieth century. widely spread bezdomenna (wold DRI &quot;) Steel -&quot;Midreks&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Non-ferrous metallurgy</strong></p>


<p>In recent years geography ferrous metallurgy has changed.Gradually shift was &quot;centers of gravity&quot; of the industry in a country thatdeveloping countries. These countries have considerable reserves of raw materials fornonferrous metallurgy, strengthen their own power base and need in nonferrous metals.</p>
<p>Important sector of ferrous metallurgy are the aluminum industry.Aluminium inherent lightness, strength, high conductivity,thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, which can be used almost everywhere. Thanks to these properties aluminum is called &quot;Kingnonferrous metals.</p>
<p>Raw materials for aluminum production in most countries - bauxite.About 85% of their reserves are concentrated in the weathering crust laterytniy in pryekvatorialniy zone. Most of the bauxite mined in AustraliaGuinea, Brazil, Jamaica. They, and the U.S., Russia, China, Canadabecome the world leader in alumina. Russia, the United States have littleBauxite, in Canada they are missing. This production based on imported raw materials.</p>
<p>In Russia&#39;s primary aluminum is also nepheline. European countriesgradually stop mining bauxite. The role of large exportersAlumina play Australia (1 / 3 of world production), Guinea,Jamaica.</p>
<p>Main source of aluminum is aircraft and rocket engineering, food industry (packaging), electrical (wire).</p>
<p>At the beginning of. largest companies in the aluminum industry is &quot;Alcoa (USA), alkane (Canada),&quot; Peshyne &quot;(France),&quot; Basic Element &quot;(Russia).</p> 
<p>The second most important sector of the global non-ferrous metals are copperindustry. Copper has good electrical and thermal conductivity. For thisindustry characterized by territorial division of production stages. The higherstage of processing, the lower its share accounted for by countriesdeveloping countries.</p>
<p>In the production of concentrate ores significant role played by countrydeveloping countries - Indonesia, China, Philippines in Asia? Zambia,Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa? Chile, Peru and Mexico in Latin America? Papua New Guinea in Oceania. Among the large developed countriesreserves of copper ores have the United States, Canada, Australia and Poland. A copper ore rich Russia and Kazakhstan. These countries also are among thethe world&#39;s leading copper concentrate.</p>
<p>In addition to these countries (this is not part of Papua New Guinea), largeworld producers of rough copper (metal content 95%) is also Japan,Germany, and refined copper (metal content 99,9%) - Belgium, South Korea. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo refined copper is produced.The entire draft copper sends it for processing to Belgium.</p>
<p>The main consumers of copper - a field of electrical engineering,electronics. Most developed countries use copper and somedeveloping countries (China, South Korea, Brazil, India).Japan, Germany, USA, China, Brass its own is not enough, because they hadimport.</p>
<p>Production of zinc and lead have traditionally focused on raw, sotheir major producers are Australia, China, Canada, USA, Peru andMexico, which possess the largest reserves of polymetallic ores.The greatest amount of lead and zinc used in developed countries(U.S., Japan, Germany) and some developing countries (in China). </p>
<p>The main area of consumption of zinc is the automotive industry. 60%Lead is also used in the automotive industry, the rest - inchemical.</p> 
<p>Production of nickel-developed in Canada (25% of world production)Russia (20%), Australia and New Caledonia. At the end of the twentieth century. thesecountries joined Cuba, Dominican Republic, Philippines. Basisarea is the use of nickel metallurgy - doping and coatingalloys.</p>
<p>The largest world producers of tin are the countries of SoutheastAsia and Latin America. Most tin is used in manufacturing gesture, but also in electrical engineering and electronics.</p>
<p>Production of silver and gold have largely dispersed. For extraction money back to the XV-XVI centuries. palm won the Latin Americancountries (Mexico, Peru, Chile, Bolivia). Geography gold mining more. Over 100 years of powerful gold producer is South Africa. ManyGold mined in African countries (eg Ghana) and in Latin America, North America and Australia. Considerableamount of gold mined in Russia and Uzbekistan.</p> 
<p>Today much of the gold mined silver Yi not ownfields, and along with other metals. Although the bulk of goldprovide indigenous deposits (gold lived &quot;), the role of alluvialdeposits. Almost 2 / 3 of the silver used in photochemistry, the rest - inelectrical engineering, electronics, jewelry industry, as well asproduction of coins, medals. Most of the gold sent forproduction of ingots and coins. Significantly smaller amounts of the consumptionjewelry industry (about 300 tons per year) and electronics.</p>
<p>Of all the gold, which presently holds humanity (120 000 t), 2 / 3 is Hispanic.</p> 
<p>Production of diamonds, other precious and semiprecious stonesbelongs to ferrous metallurgy. Traditionally, the world leader indiamond is Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana,Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo). In the second half of the twentieth century.large-scale diamond mining began USSR (Russia continued), andlate twentieth century. - Australia.</p>
<p>Of the 94 million carats of diamonds recovered, more than half is used inproduction tools (cutting, polishing), the rest - in jewelry industry. Nearly 3 / 4 of diamonds used - artificial. ThereCUT rich tradition of diamonds in India, the Netherlands, Belgium, Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Engineering world.</strong></p>
<p>Engineering World - a leading industry, whose share in valueis about 1 / 3 of world industrial output. It largely determines the general directions of scientific and technological progress. Endproduct industry is the equipment (more than 1 million species) for all withoutthe sectors of economy. Mechanical Engineering is also working onmeet the needs of individual users.</p>
<p>&quot;Motherland&quot; engineering rightly called the GreatBritain. This industry began to thrive here in the late eighteenth century. Onearly nineteenth century. engineering has been popular in WesternEurope (Netherlands, France, Germany) and the U.S. in the late nineteenth century. - InCentral and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the RussianEmpire and the early twentieth century. - Worldwide.</p> 
<p>On the placement of mechanical engineering enterprises in various sectors affectingfollowing factors: the level of science, the availability of labor resources(Particularly skilled) resources (construction materials,especially metal), the consumer. Also play a significant rolespecialization and cooperation.</p>
<p>Since any machine made by assembly (mounting) oflarge number of parts, machine technology is dividedat least two stages: manufacture of parts and komplektatsiynyhassembly of finished products from kompletatsiynyh details. Productionkomplektatsiynyh modern parts, components and machinery intensive,technologically sophisticated and capable of only developed countries. MakeMachine parts can kompletatsiynyh and in the averagedevelopment. There is enough human resources to use with an averagebasic education, trained in certain transactions. These factors influenced thespread of machinery in the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Today, world leaders in the field of engineering is developedcountry. U.S., Japan, Germany produced almost the entire known rangeengineering products. Thus the U.S. specializing in the productionpowerful supercomputers (servers) and aerospace engineering; Japan -sophisticated home appliances, electronics, automobiles, ships,industrial equipment and robotics, Germany - industrialequipment (mainly electrical), automobiles, printingequipment. France, Britain, Italy also produce a largenumber of engineering products. Recently, world leadersmachinery involved in South Korea. Small WesternEurope, with minor amounts of engineering products.However, given its high quality, they are able to control largemarket share. For example, Switzerland is specialized in manufacturingprecision machine tools, watches, equipment formills, Austria produces Mining machinery and equipmentpulp and paper industry, Netherlands - Electricequipment; Denmark - industrial refrigerators and sea fishing vessels;Sweden - industrial electrical engineering and automobiles, Finland - floatingdrilling rigs and mobile phones.</p>
<p>The first region of the developing countries, which appearedengineering, was Latin America. This industry was created here bydirect participation of developed countries and was aimed primarily atmeet the needs of the region. Currently, the major countries of the region isnearly all known mechanical engineering. In addition, some countries(Mainly Mexico and Brazil) are to increase productionfor export.</p>
<p>In East and Southeast Asia Development Engineeringbegan only 60 years of the twentieth century. It also created bywith developed countries, but it is export oriented. Forrecent decades, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand,Philippines, Indonesia become powerful producers of household appliances,electronics, communications, and automobiles and othervehicles. In 80 years of the twentieth century. spread in engineeringChina, India, Turkey, Iran and &quot;most qualified&quot; Africancountries - Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria.</p>
<p>The level of engineering in a particular country canjudged in terms of volumes of export sector (in billion dollars.USA) and the share of industry in the exporting country. World leader in absolute indicators are developed countries. U.S., Germany, Japan -traditionally the largest exporters of engineering products. Theygo to European countries and Canada.

<p>Manufacture of machine tools and metaloobroblyuvalnohoEquipment - a leading global engineering industries,Geography is the last half century has experienced drastic changes. Ifearlier leaders were countries such as USA, Germany, Switzerland, Italy,then later the U.S. is almost entirely lost to Japan, Taiwan, China.Retained their positions, Germany, Switzerland, Italy. Japan and Germanyspecialize in manufacturing complex machines and powerful streamlines Switzerland - precision machine tools, Italy, Taiwan, China -other modern machines. The share of exportsMachine Tool highest in Switzerland (90%), Taiwan and Germany(2 / 3). The powerful robots and photographic manufacturers are Japan and Sweden.</p>
<p>Among the areas of transport engineering <strong>automotive </strong>holds a leading position. It emerged in the late nineteenth century. in Europe and then quickly penetrated into the U.S..</p>
<p>Revolution in the automotive industry was the invention and introduction ofG. Ford factory of the world&#39;s belt (1913). The division of labor on a number of specialized phases allowed to reduce the time of onecar from 12.5 hours to 93 minutes, almost 8 times. At the same plant began extensive use of black ink that sohla faster than others.</p> 
<p>Japan&#39;s success in the global automotive market explain the fact that she staked on the production of economic small cars. By sometimes this fact coincided with the global oil crisis, economyas an important factor in marketing.</p>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century. U.S. produced 80% of all carsworld. In 50 years of the twentieth century. car spread to mostEuropean and Latin American countries and in 70 years - to Japan.At the end of the twentieth century. car spread to all regions of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Chemical Industry.</strong></p>
<p> At the present stage one of the most important industries arechemical. At the edge of the XVIII-XIX. produced in the chemical industry bases,acid, soda, ammonia, some types of fertilizers. In the second halfNineteenth century. supplemented their plastics, chemical fibers, rubber-technical products natural rubber. The real flowering of the chemical industry is of the twentieth century. In the early twentieth century. of the global chemical industryproduction was the basic chemistry (inorganic) in mid-centuryit changed the chemistry of organic synthesis (including the production of polymermaterials), and finally - fine chemicals (pharmaceutical,perfume and cosmetics, household, photochemistry, biochemistry). If initiallytotal production of plastics dominated termoaktyvniPlastics, then later took their place thermoplastics (egpolyethylene), artificial fibers were eventually superseded by synthetic andnatural rubber - synthetic.</p>

<p>Now the chemical industry along with mechanical engineering is the&quot;Locomotive&quot; of world scientific and technological progress. It is in this areais no small share of scientific discoveries. Many kinds of chemicalproducts far outstrips in quality of natural analogues successfullyreplacing them.</p>
<p>The development of chemical technologies and identified the main types used raw materials. First of all it concerns the chemistry of organic synthesis.

<p>Undisputed leader on the development of chemical industry isdeveloped countries. They not only produce more of all chemicalproducts, but also the current structure. For example, most developedcountries produce sulfuric acid and fertilizer less than plastic. Bycost of production first in these countries occupy the fieldfine chemicals.</p>
<p>Due to the large variety of chemicals formedspecialization of certain countries in the chemical industry. Of all U.S. tapcapable of producing all kinds of chemicals in large quantities.

<p><strong>Forest and woodworking industry</strong> - One of theoldest branches. Since people do wood homes, manufactured itemsLife means of transportation. With the development of science and technology of woodgave way to other construction materials - metal, plastic,because of its scope considerably narrowed. Today the treeproduced building materials, furniture, paper, cardboard, some chemicaldrugs and household items.</p>
<p>In the second half of the twentieth century. Forest industry under the influencescientific and technological progress has changed significantly: increase took placeproduct quality, reduce its cost.</p> 
<p>These days, with 1 m? produce more wood productsthan before and reduced waste. Geography has changedindustry. Earlier harvesting and wood processing are concentrated in developed countries or in the northern forest belt, in the lastquarter of the twentieth century. more than half of the wood were to provideterritory of developing countries or in the southern forest zone.Under a change in raw materials: typical for developed countriesmostly coniferous forests, and for developing countries - platyphyllous. Inglobalizing world economy international companies movedmuch of its manufacturing base in rich forest resources of the country,developing countries. But at the present stage for the forest industrythis characteristic pattern: the higher the degree of processing of wood,the larger the share of developed countries in the market. This means that countries thatdeveloping countries have become suppliers of raw materials only, not the manufacturersthe final product.</p>
<p>Now the world are storing about 3.3 billion m? wood. Thismore than 1 / 2 is used as fuel (firewood). The rest - industrial wood, that comes to recycling. The depth of wood processing in different countriesDivers. In the U.S., Canada and most European countries, Japanclose to 100%. That is, from 1 m? raw wood made about 1m? useful products. For most developing countries, thisScore ranges from 20-30%. At the same time: one partharvested timber is wood and the other almost completely in exporting developed countries, where it is processed. For example, Japanese companiesengaged in harvesting timber in Southeast Asia, usuallyplucked from the tree roots. At the processing is all tree - roots,slash.</p>
<p>To increase the efficiency of the bulk timberstoring in those regions where there is its quick recovery. Indeveloped countries - is primarily a temperate maritime climate: northeast and northwest USA, southwest of Canada, allNorth Europe. In developing countries, storingtimber in the humid zone of equatorial evergreen forests (Indonesia,Malaysia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, South NigeriaBrazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia).</p>
<p>The volume of timber retain the leading position other developed countries (USA, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Germany,France, Japan) and Russia. In recent years significantly increasedLumber production in some developing countries (China,India, Indonesia, Brazil, Chile).</p> 
<p>Woodworking small European countries narrowlySpecialized in the production of individual products. For example, in termsmanufacture of plywood and fibreboard leading places in the worldare countries such as Austria, Portugal. The largest in the worldproducing developed countries. Even half a century ago they made only of entire boards, now - with a chipboard (DSP). To produce expensive luxury furniture boards covering layer of natural wood (veneer) thickness of 2-3 mm. About 4 / 5 furniture veneer with valuable tropicalwood on the world market supplies Brazil. Deep traditionsfurniture remained in Italy. Furniture high quality of its ownwood (beech, hornbeam) produces Romania.</p>
<p>The most important forest products industry is cellulose,paper and board. The volume of paper leading places in the worldtraditionally developed countries (USA, Japan, Canada, Germany,Nordic countries). Rapidly increasing volumes of paper some developing countries (China, Brazil, India, Mexico). InChina, much of the paper produced from rice straw.In the Brazilian Amazon, in the mouth, the heat, operates a powerful floatingPulp and Paper Mill, built in Japan.</p>
<p>The volume of paper per capita world leaders are Nordic countries, Canada, Austria. Thus Canadaspecializes in the manufacture of newsprint, Finland, Sweden,Norway - the office. In all developed countries produce a lotwrapping paper.</p>
<p>The main products are dendrochemistry charcoal HYDROLIZEDalcohol, turpentine, fodder yeast. Activation of harvesting tropicalwood affected the formation of such areas as collecting resin, wax,some types of oils.</p>
<p><strong>Light industry.</strong></p>
<p>Light industry - a set of industries, enterprises areproduced consumer items. It belongs to the oldest industries.</p>

<p>Manufacture of textile fibers, leather and fur animals for the production Clothing man mastered long ago. Over time, new types were usedraw materials (chemical fibers, artificial leather), the production graduallyinfluenced fashion, improved product quality. A change in organizational light industrial structure: if previously manufactured clothing and footwearsmall shops, now mostly work by large companies. Importantrole played by fashion houses began to develop new models of clothesand shoes, then reproduce large companies. In the second half of the twentieth century.much of the productive base of these companies has shifted from developedcountries to tap the developing world, ie, closer to raw materials and cheapworkforce. In developed countries produce elite and expensiveproducts.</p>
<p>Great fashion centers are traditionally Paris, Milan, London, New York.</p>
<p>The leading branch of the global textile industry is cotton,followed - silk, wool, flax, hemp, jute. Of the totalnumber of textile raw materials used, about 2 / 3cotton accounted for 1 / 5 - on chemical fiber (mostly -synthetic), 1 / 10 - on wool, a little more than 1,5% - byflax dovhunets.</p>
