It borders with North Korea, China,Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus,Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Norway. Has access toSea basin three oceans the Atlantic, Pacific and NorthArctic, they account for 2 / 3 of all the nation. It occupies first place in the world.</p><p>The surface of the country has a complex structure. Overall surface areapredominantly flat - up to 70% represent the plains and plateaus. Most of the European territory of Russia is located withinEast European Plain. In the south - the northern slopes of the Caucasus, innorthwest - Mount Hibiny. To the east of the Urals - the West Siberianplain surrounded by mountains in the south of Southern Siberia (Altai, Sayan MountainsBaikal, Transbaikalia). Between the Yenisey and Leno locatedSrednosybirske plateau, between Leno and the Pacific Ocean - and ridgesHighlands North-East Asia. East of the country belongs to the seismicallydangerous. On the Kamchatka Peninsula is located 120 volcanoes, 23 of them are applicable. Geographically the country geographically and can be divided into threelarge natural regions: the European part, Siberia, the Far East.</p><p>Most of the country&#39;s territory lies in the temperate zone. Climate changes of the sea in the far northwest to the sharplycontinental in Siberia and monsoonal in the Far East. AverageJanuary temperatures from 0 to-500C, July 1 to 250S. Annual precipitationfrom 150 to 2000 mm per year. In many parts of Siberia and the Far East -perennial frost. Within Russia recorded the lowest temperatureNorthern Hemisphere: 720S-in area of </p><p>The country has significant reserves of water resources. On its territory there are More than 120 large and small rivers, most of them are Lena, Irtysh, Yenisei,Ob, Volga, Amur, North Dvina, Pechora, Kolyma, Don, the largest lake -Caspian, Baikal, Ladoga, Onega, Hanka. Most rivers areshipping, the total of shipping is more than 400 thousandkm.</p><p>From north to south in Russia located natural areas: arctic deserts, tundra, tundra, forests (taiga, mixed anddeciduous), forest-steppe, steppe, semidesert. A large areaRussia occupied by coniferous forests, which are divided in species composition ofsvitlohvoynu (pine, Siberian larch and daurska) andtemnohvoynu taiga (spruce, fir, cedar pine). 2 / 5 of the countrycovered by forests, it is - the largest forest resources in the world. Inmany parts of Siberia and the Far East - the permafrost.</p><p>Minerals has a rich list: petroleum, natural gas,stone and brown coal, peat, ore: iron, manganese, colormetals: bauxite, chromite, vanadium, copper, lead, tin, nickel, zinc,cobalt, tungsten, molybdenum, antimony, mercury, uranium, gold, platinum,platinum, chemical raw materials: apatites, phosphates, sulfur, magnesite,asbestos, mica, graphite, potassium and kitchen, Glauber salt, diamonds,semi-precious stones (amethyst, garnet, topaz), malachite, jade,marble, etc..</p><p><strong>Population</strong>. Russia - a multinational state withcolorful ethnic and religious composition of the population, 80% of whichare Russians, but they live in the country of 156 people, mostnumerous of them - Tatar, Ukrainian, Bashkir, Chuvash, Chechens, Germans,Belarusians, Kazakhs, Jews, coma, Buryatia.</p><p>Main religion - Christianity, many believers - Orthodox(90%) are Muslims, Buddhists and others. Many people - Non-believers and skeptics (the consequences of over seven decades of atheisticof Soviet power). The official language is Russian, its people speak over 100 languages</p><p>The average population density - 8.5 persons. km2, over 80% of the population residing in the European part of the country, representing about 30% of itsterritory, urban population is 73% of the total.The average population density in the European part of the country exceeds 100people. per km2. This represents an uneven distribution of populationterritory of the state and a high level of urbanization. The largest city andwith them most of the population is concentrated in the so-called&quot;The main bar of the resettlement of the population,&quot; which is a putativelarge triangle, the apex of which is in the North - St. Petersburg, forsouth - Novorossiysk, on the east - Krasnoyarsk. Within this triangleare major cities, home to one fifth of the totalpopulation. Major cities in Russia, 10, most of themlocated in the European part of the country: Moscow, St. Petersburg,Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Samara, Omsk, Chelyabinsk,Kazan, Ufa.</p> <p align="center"><img src="/images/g11b/g10-11_27_files/image002.jpg"></p><p align="center"><strong>&quot;Aurora&quot; - the ship-museum.
