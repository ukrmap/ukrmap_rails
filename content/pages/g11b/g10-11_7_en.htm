<p><strong>The world&#39;s population.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Population (population)</strong> - Natural historyemerged and continuously samovidnovlyuvana during playbackdirect life bunch of people, the main component of humansociety.</p>
<p>The population of any territory or country by engaging in interaction withenvironment, acts on the one hand the power that createswealth, on the other - which consumes them. Thereforesocio-economic science is very important with the basic knowledgeindicators of population size, its geography,structure and dynamics of change. Population studies a number of science -Geography of Population, etnoheohrafiya, demography.</p>
<p>According to statistical data on the territory of living EarthOver 6.8 billion people. The largest population of the world is China (1.3 billion people), India (1.1 billion), USA (307 million), Indonesia (240million), Brazil (198 million).</p>
<p>Dynamics of change of the world population was different throughout history humanity. Since the appearance of man on Earth for manythousands of population growth was negligible, then began to rise and now again decreases.</p>
<p>The first &quot;population explosion&quot; is on the seventeenth-nineteenth century. WhenWorld population reaches through the Industrial Revolution in 1830 by one billion people. In subsequent years the pace of population growthincreases conditional on the increase and decrease in fertilitymortality in industrialized countries of Europe and North America.After 100 years the Earth&#39;s population doubled and amounted to 2billion people in 30 years (60 years of the twentieth century.) - tripled (3 billionpeople) and in 1975 - grew to 4 billion people. At the beginning of.multiplicity of the population was over 6 billion people.</p>
<p>The largest growth rate of world population in the history of mankindfall to 60-years of the twentieth century. - The second &quot;population explosion&quot;. Throughtraditionally high birth rate and reducing mortality due todevelopment of medicine and quality of life in Latin America and Asia, developing an average annual population growth exceeded 3%.</p>
<p>At the beginning of. serednosvitovi population growth rates were 1,4 ‰, among this in Africa - 2,6 ‰, Asia and Latin America -1.5 Step 2 ‰, in Europe - 0,3 ‰.</p>
<p>According to the UN by 2025 the world population will reach 8.3billion people and by the end of the XXI century. stabilized at around 10? 12 billion</p>
<p>Natural movement of population. The population is influenced Vital (play) - fertility and population processesmortality. Natural movement makes continuous process of change of generations andpopulation recovery. In order to be able to compare the rates of such play in countries that differ in population, calculate the average birth and death rates for 1000persons per year (ppm -% 0). The difference between fertility rates anddeath called natural growth. Ratio of natural increase can have positive, negative or zero value, indicatingincrease, decrease or invariance of the population.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Natural population growth</strong></p> 

<p>Different stages of human development characterized by certain features of historical <strong>Reproduction</strong>. Natural movement of population depends on the socio-economic factorsparticular type of economic model of society. The theory that explainsinterdependence between the phases of development of world economy(Pryvlasnyuvalne, agricultural, industrial, postindustrialmanagement) and demographic processes (fertility, mortality,natural increase), was named <strong>demographic transition theory</strong>.</p>
<p>Stage pryvlasnyuvalnoho economy characterized by dominationbirth at the biological maximum, but low leveldevelopment of medicine, problems with food supplies, waralso contributed to high mortality. Therefore, these indexes were balanced and sometimes even death prevailed. This type of population reproductioncalled <strong>traditional</strong>.</p>
<p>Agrarian society, which characterized by numerous family, which isthe main producer of wealth, combined with advances medicine helpssignificant increase in fertility and population growth - <strong>boomers</strong>. This play is called population <strong>advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>In the era of industrialization, the family loses its major economic rolelevel: it does not define bahatochyselnist commercial success.Economic importance individual personality traits of man -education, entrepreneurship, creativity. The growing populationslows down, low birth offset low mortality.This type of reproduction is called <strong>simple</strong>.</p>
<p>Society in the era of post-industrial economy characterized by welfare, increased cultural development of health that helps to reduce mortality and increase in expectancylife. Such processes lead to <strong>aging</strong>.Representation of women in social production and growth costseducation and child development help reduce fertility. Naturalreduced growth in some countries mortality rates exceedbirth, there <strong>depopulation</strong> - The natural population decline. This type of reproduction is called <strong>diminished</strong>.</p>
<p>In the modern world the level of socio-economic development of countries isdifferent, they are at different stages of demographic transitionand dissimilar demographics.</p>
<p>According to today Historically <strong>Two types of population reproduction</strong> (Processes of generations).</p> 
<p>For <strong>the first type of reproduction</strong> (On the theorydemographic transition are appropriate and easy and narrowed typereproduction) characterized by low fertility rates and mortalitysignificant life, each family usually one or two children. Hetypical of developed countries.</p>
<p><strong>The second type of reproduction</strong> characteristic of countriesdeveloping countries. Typical for it are high fertility rates(25-40 ‰), mortality (7-14 ‰), low life expectancy (on the theorydemographic transition it corresponds to extended reproduction).</p>
<p>For the implications on the reproduction of state may conduct <strong>demographic policy </strong>- A system of administrative, economic, propaganda activities aimed at changing the birth rate in the desired direction.</p>
<p>Most of the second type of play engaged in policycontainment and reduction of child birth (up to 5 years) mortality. In many countries, legislation increasing the age of marriage,promote the benefits maloditnoyi family. This seven pits state provides anumber of benefits.</p>
<p>The greatest successes in this policy have made China and India. In Chinapopulation policy has a motto: &quot;One family - one child&quot;, &quot;Chinese -people without siblings. The country has established State Committeefamily planning, set higher age limits for entry intomarriage. Thus, the limit for women 22 years for men - 24. Odnoditni familyusing a number of benefits: allowance,free medical care, access to education. In Indiahas a slogan: &quot;We are two - we two.&quot;</p>
<p>However, not all developing countries, conduct demographicpolicy. Muslim countries do not interfere with natural processesReproduction, guided by religious morality, and Africa -due to lack of material means.</p>
<p>Most other problems in developed countries. Fertility in thesegenerally low, and therefore the population is growing slowly. There is a problem of scarcity of human resources. In connection with this countrypursue policies aimed at increasing the birth rate: singlePayment Suite, government assistance at birth, monthlypayments for children, benefits, loans for large families and more.</p>
<p>In general the world community seeks to control the number ofpopulation on the planet in order to prevent aggravation of the political,demographic, socio-economic situation on the planet.</p>
