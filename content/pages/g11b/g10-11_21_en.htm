<p>During the &quot;Cold War doctrine of nuclear deterrence prevailed for
maintaining international stability and security of States. During nuclear
deterrence understand a variety of foreign policy for
reduction of the military dangers of active deterrence of aggressors
any attempts to solve military conflicts and wars. In modern
the world is the concept of nuclear multipolarity, which means that
several states with nuclear weapons deterrent. Construction of non-nuclear
the world is currently unrealistic, because nuclear weapons remain one of
 important elements of world politics in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The negative impact of militarization (from Lat. <em>militaris</em> -
military), that military power, not only the economy but also on
 society in general. Every year the world spent on military needs
about 1 trillion dollars. Almost half of these costs are two states - the United States and
 Russia. In some countries, military spending in excess of 1 / 10 of their GDP
 especially in those who are constantly engaged in military confrontation (North
 Korea, most Gulf countries, etc.).. Some few of
per capita income countries are investing more money in military
sphere than in the social, such as China, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria,
Cuba, Vietnam and others. To meet the demand for military goods and
services, according to UNESCO, has 50 million people in the development of military
character involved half a million scientists and designers, or 1 / 5

weapons have 5 countries - members of the &quot;nuclear club&quot;: U.S., Russia, France,
United Kingdom, China. The first two have several tens of thousands
nuclear charges, the last - to one thousand charges each. In addition,
nuclear arsenal is in the so-called &quot;new nuclear states - India,
Pakistan, North Korea, Israel (not formally recognizes the existence

<p><strong>Food problem.</strong> At the beginning of the XXI century. Food
 problem was exacerbated in the world, due to the current speed
population growth compared with the production
Food, a significant reduction of arable land and freshwater
water needed for agricultural production.
Inaccessibility to many of the chemicals, irrigation, integrated
Mechanization also leads to a stabilization or decrease in
food production, particularly the most important product
agriculture - grain.</p>
<p>According to different estimates, each year at the Earth from dying of hunger
13 to 18 million people, half of them - children. Number of victims of hunger
 so, like every three days on the planet explodes bomb, equivalent to
dropped on Hiroshima.</p>
<p>According to the Food and Agricultural Organization, the
2008 the number of those going hungry worldwide rose by 40 million people and
reached 963 million 907 million people starving and living in countries that
developing countries. Of these, 65% live in India, China, Congo, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia. In southern Africa one in three people
suffers from chronic hunger.</p>
<p>Partial replenishment of food resources at the expense
World Ocean. For example, over the past half century, ocean fishing
fish increased almost 5 times. But unregulated fishing undermines
ocean resources. Lack of food leads not only to malnutrition and
hunger, but also to the rapid exhaustion of suitable farming
farm land to poor health, conflict and
increased tensions in some regions.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Calorie diet. Health</strong></p>


<p>Residents of the earth as a whole provided enough food, but in some
regions and countries is lack of food, while others -
surplus. There are three types of food: natural, cultured and
industrial. Natural food obtained from the collection,
hunting and fishing. Agriculture and animal husbandry, which gives people
food virtually unprocessed form, called
extinct. Food industry produces food, processed
 enterprises, ie industrial food. In the modern era
 rapidly increasing share of industrial food products, especially in
 developed countries and, in the developing world, remains a significant
share of natural and cultivated food.</p>
<p>For the XXI century. characterized not only lack of food, but its
low quality, low content of basic nutrients (proteins,
vitamins, trace elements). According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), approximately 1 / 2 the world&#39;s population as poor and in
rich countries, suffers from minimal or improper diet.
About 2 billion people, eating normally, shortages
vitamins and minerals. In developing countries, chronic
about 800 million hungry people. On the other hand, people and obesity
Food anomalies - a new manifestation of food problem, especially in
developed countries.</p>
<p>In connection with the food problem in many countries there
problem of food security. For lack of food in
State requires imports from other countries, leading to dependence on
such deliveries. Food exporting countries can dictate
conditions of the importing countries, threatening their security and independence.
 The U.S. and France self-sufficient in food above 100
%, And in some Western European countries it is close to 100%. Russia
provided food only half.</p>
<p>The balance between the need tai food availability is determined
probation. According to FAO - International Agriculture and Food
 Organization of the UN, at the beginning of the XXI century. average citizen
Earth eat 2718 calories daily, a resident of African countries - 2300, Europe
 - 3410, North America - 3383. Estimated standard diet for one
 man is 2500 kcal per day. Malnutrition occurs when
decreases the amount of calories to 1800 and below. At 1000 kcal per day
comes hunger. Hidden hunger is characterized by lack of protein, fat,
vitamins and trace elements (in practically one type of food
products such as rice, potatoes). However, the calorific value
ration can hide the number of those who hunger. More objective assessment is
 masses of people. The most difficult children suffer from malnutrition. Malnutrition
leads to a weakening of the immune system, slow physical
development shown on the abilities of the child. Malnutrition and hunger are
most important causes of mortality.</p>
<p>Home food problem in developing countries - lack
food, which causes - rapid population growth,
urbanization, specialization in production of export crops. Many
developing countries, exporting coffee, bananas, flowers and other
culture, getting the currency to pay huge foreign debts. At
This production of food crops in these countries is reduced.
&quot;Free&quot; trade in agricultural products on world markets and
 international agreements within the World Trade Organization (WTO)
allow farmers from developed countries to sell in countries that
developing countries, cheap food, with production subsyduvaly
state. Production is a competitive local producers that
also leads to a decrease in food security that
developing countries.</p>
<p>Population growth significantly outpacing production
food in developing countries where the prevailing traditional
farming system. Not enough funds for high-yielding varieties of seeds
 and thoroughbred animals, fertilizer and chemicals, agricultural machinery and
 creation of enterprises processing agricultural produce.
For these countries, characterized by predominance, usually a consumer
culture. In the countries of South and Southeast Asia in the diet
nutrition prevails rice (75%), which allows us
distribution is &quot;rice&quot; type food. &quot;Corn&quot; type of food
characteristic of Mexico, Venezuela and some Central American countries and
 East Africa. Monotonous diet does not meet
physiological demands, which are necessary proteins and fats
animal and vegetable origin, carbohydrates, vitamins and
trace elements.</p>
<p>Hunger, malnutrition, lack of vitamins and trace elements in food population
 in developing countries, reduce productivity, resulting
 huge financial losses to these countries for a year - from 64 to 128 billion
dollars. Developing countries are forced to import food
spending a significant portion of its revenue from exports. This undermines
economy of some countries, strengthening their economic backwardness.</p>
<p>In developed countries there is also a food problem, and her other
aspects. There are more goods of animal products,
population consumes a lot of fatty and sweet food, leading to
overeating. Work in cities is not associated with major physical
loads and requires no increase calorie diet. In Europe
 and North America fats and oils gradually lose ground grain diet and
 vegetables. Products of American fast food &quot;fast food&quot;
contain excessive amount of fat and sugar, adverse health
human components. All this led to what the U.S. adult
55% of the population overweight. A similar situation has
 in Western Europe. Overeating as hunger, has negative consequences:
increased susceptibility to disease (diabetes, hypertension and others.)
increased mortality. Along with the excessive consumption of food
followed by food allergy, food hypersensitivity (symptoms: headache,
anxiety, increased aggressiveness, etc..) gastric disease.</p>
<strong>You can identify these solutions to food problems:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>soil fertility of arable land in developing countries. But
using large doses of fertilizers and pesticides, especially in
countries with low-culture farming, can lead to contamination
not only the natural environment, but also very food. All this can
adversely affect human health even in countries that do not
applying chemicals because of poverty, but use imported
food. Fertility can significantly increase due to irrigation
lands. However, this requires clean fresh water. Irrigation salted
and contaminated water leads to lower quality land and production;
  </li>
    <li>application of modern biotechnology achievements, especially
genetically modified (GM) food, and has a fantastic
opportunities to increase production volumes. Main Directions
Biotechnology: impact on the formation and development of some organisms
active substances (hormones) of others; tissue culture (cultivation
 required for human cells and tissues outside the living organisms), gene
engineering, ie changes of plants and animals on the basis of recombination
DNA. For example, using such technologies was obtained special
variety of rice - &quot;golden rice&quot; that contains the most important health
trace elements not found in standard varieties of the crop.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, genetically modified crops spread to developed
countries, but not in those developing countries where the vast majority
those starving. In the U.S., more than half of soybean crop accounted for
genetically modified varieties. On the other hand, science still does not give clear
 answers to neutral or dangerous for human health
use of genetically modified food.</p>
<p>Solving the food problem is also linked to the rational
use of ocean resources and increasing its
productivity (mariculture, etc..) improvement of environmental conditions on
Earth.</p>
<p><strong>The demographic problem.</strong> The essence of global demographic
 the problem is the rapid and uncontrolled growth of
world population, causing many problems. This problem of providing
food, to education, employment and quality of life
shortage of natural resources, ecology and instability in the world.
Global demographic issue is mainly with demographic
situation in developing countries but also in developed countries
certain demographic problems are growing.</p>
<p>Fertility and mortality depend on the material conditions of life,
traditions and features of society. The main trend is the beginning of XXI century. -
 decrease in fertility and mortality. After the demographic
explosion occurred stage &quot;demographic decline&quot;, which is characterized
reduced fertility. Increase expectancy
life caused a slight reduction in mortality.</p>
<p>In the second half of XX century, most developing countries, faced
 With the rapid population growth, which virtually wiped out
 progress and economic growth has generated a lot of social and
environmental problems. Reduction in fertility in countries that
emerging markets have closed the gap between countries with different levels
economic development. In developed countries also have their own demographic
problem. This shortage of manpower, which causes labor
immigration from poor countries. And the presence of foreign labor force leads
to tension in the IST.</p>
<p>Solve demographic problems is closely connected with solving other global problems.</p> 
<p><strong>Energy and raw material problems.</strong> Natural resources
not only determine the comfort of mankind, but the very possibility
 life on Earth. Energy and raw material problem - a problem
provision of human energy and raw materials. This problem first
demonstrated in 70-ies of the last century. XX and XXI centuries. characterized
exceptionally rapid growth in production of minerals.
For example, currently produced annually from the depths of more than 100 billion tons of mineral
resources, not counting hundreds of billions of related rocks. If
rate of increase in mineral resources remain, the
approximately 200 years the annual removal of rocks will be
amount equal to the volume of crust of continents (250000000000000000 t), which
stands above the oceans, which is practically impossible.</p>
<p>Main modern primary problem - the limited resources that are easily
mined, and thus their production is economically viable. Complete
exhaustion of mineral resources are not talking because the rocks
Earth&#39;s crust and oceans of water have a huge number of chemical
elements. For example, one cubic kilometer of granite includes millions
tons of silicon, hundreds of thousands of tons of various metals, and in the waters of the World
Ocean dissolved about 10 million tons of gold and a huge number of other
chemical elements. But the cost of extracting these items today
huge and the technology is far from perfect. In this connection it is
 problem of scarcity of mineral resources and of conclusion that can
cause conflict between countries on this ground.</p>
<p>The costs of exploration and extraction more
hard (hlybokozalyahayuchyh located in remote areas
continent or ocean) mineral deposits quickly
increase. For example, in the depths of the Arctic Ocean shelf
tayatsya huge hydrocarbon reserves, but its production
need an offshore drilling platform ultrahigh strength that can
resist moving ice and ice or underwater (ice) plant.
All this requires considerable cost and creation of a new
technologies.</p>
<p>The current resident of the United States during his life an average of
more than 1200 tons of minerals, thermal energy, equal to 4000
barrel of oil, consuming 25 tons and 28 tons of vegetable animal food manufacturing
about 12 tons of waste. If in future the international community will
this level of consumption, it would require a fantastic amount
raw materials, fuel, food, a huge mass utvoryuvatymetsya
waste.</p>
<p>At present level of energy efficiency is very
low and the average in the world (including all technological
chain) is 5 - 7%. Thus, there are more potential than
tenfold increase in energy efficiency,
price increases that will promote energy conservation.</p>
<p>In the distant future due to energy growth
 energy consumption compared to GDP growth will decrease.
Now the European average increase in energy consumption per capita
mainly associated with rapid growth of this indicator in the
Latin America, East and Southeast Asia. According to forecasts,
20 years 70% increase in energy consumption will be determined by country
developing countries. This can exacerbate environmental problems in the world if
due to lack of funds to developing countries, use
imperfect technology. Access to energy sources, the availability of these sources
eligibility (primarily environmental) of their society are the most important
economic conditions Energy XXI century.</p>
<p>Today humanity is almost completely depends on the volume
oil, natural gas, coal and other mineral
fuel. It is predicted that by mid-XXI century. increased dependence
 developed countries on imports of oil and natural gas. Oil will remain
the main energy source in coming decades, the share of natural gas
will grow rapidly, and the share of coal - will gradually decline.
Probably, the maximum increase will be in solar, geothermal, wind
 and other alternative energy forms, but the value of their technology
use remains very high. In Power
expected significant reduction in the share of nuclear power plants. For example, in the U.S. and Western
Europe provides for replacement of plant environmentally friendly (gas) power station.
The share of hydropower plants also reduced due to exhaustion hidroenerhoresursiv.</p>
<p>Envisaged two stages of development of energy: the first -
rapid rozvyvatok gas industry and energy, the
second - new energy sources (thermonuclear fusion, etc.)..</p>
<p>No less acute primary problem. Raw material resources of the Earth
are not endless. Not only depleted mineral, but
territorial resources. Today already 56% developed land surface of Earth.
 Given the growth rate of extraction of mineral resources mineral resources
question of their raw material depletion and hunger. But searches
deposits will be conducted as long as it is economically viable.
There are other ways - the replacement of scarce raw materials artificial
materials, recycling of huge deposits of &quot;tails&quot;
mining and processing plants and dump pits.</p>
<p>In the long term, humanity will be able to extract from the mountain
rock crust and oceans of water and use of all chemical
elements, complementing their range of artificial materials.</p>
<p>Of the above problem is closely related to the problem of overcoming
backwardness and poverty in developing countries. Population did
territories of the globe suffer from poverty, hunger, disease, unemployment
 and illiteracy. Today in the poorest 1.2 billion people around
live below the poverty threshold, more than 1 billion illiterate, more than 1.5 billion
denied basic medical care, every third child under 5 years
 hunger.</p>

The huge scale of poverty and backwardness have questioned the progress

<p>The American edition of The Forbes has published a ranking of most
environmentally friendly countries in 2008 140 countries were evaluated in 25
criteria (ranging from clean air and water quality and finishing
variant and the use of biological pesticides).</p>
<p>Cleanest in the world recognized Switzerland (one of the richest countries
svitiu in terms of per capita GDP), which scored 100 points for
8 environmental criteria including water quality, quantity and purity
 forests, minimal use of pesticides.</p>
<p>In Sweden consistently high environmental performance, which directly
displayed on the health of its residents. This low level of contamination
air, clean drinking water, low greenhouse gas emissions, careful
attitude to forests.</p>
<p>Norway - is one of the richest countries, which boasts
excellent water quality, sanitation (effective treatment),
air. Norwegians least prone to respiratory diseases.</p>
