<p>Asia, the largest in area and population of the region of the world(About 43.4 million km 2 with the Asian territory of Russia). The boundary betweenAsia and Europe is usually done Urals (his crest and easternfoot, the river Emba, Kuma, Manych, axial watershed of the Great Caucasus Caspian, Azov, Black and Marmara seas, straits.Bosporus and Dardanelles). In Africa, Asia combined Suez isthmus, fromNorth America separated Bering Strait.

The regionalso includes the islands: Japan, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Philippine,Big and Small Sunda - an area more than 2 million km2.</p>
<p>In the geographical literature of the region is usually divided into: <strong>South-Western, Central, South, Southeast and East Asia</strong>. Differ between regions of a complex religious, ethnic,linguistic, natural and historical factors.

<p>The first countries in the region were Mesopotamia, India and China. From thistime the political map of the region suffered constant changes. Since the XVI century. herebegan to take shape colonial empires of European countries, Metropolitanwhich were Great Britain, France, Russia. Most of the modernindependent Asian countries formed after World War II, the countryCentral Asia gained independence in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991In the early XXI century. colonies in the region have not been and there are 51independent state.</p>
<p>In 11 countries with population over 100 million people. six(China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan) are inAsia, along with these countries there are micro-giants(Singapore, Bahrain, Maldives).

<p><strong>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Brunei, Oman </strong>- exporting countries of oil and gas, occupy a special place in the economyregion and a high standard of living. Significant role in the economyregion play a so-called &quot;Asian tigers&quot; first wave: KoreaSouth, Taiwan, Singapore and new industrial countries of the second wave:Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam.</p>

In Asia, represented the full range of options for the state system of republics with democratic traditions (India, Israel) to the absolutetheocratic monarchies (Oman, Saudi Arabia).</p>

Hot arid sands of Arabia andjungles of Indochina, deserted snow covered Himalayan peaks andcrowded fertile plains of Hindustan and Java, endless expanses of steppeMongolia and the same endless expanses of mountainous Tibet - all Asia.</p>
<p>The average height of the area about 900 m, the largest - 8,848 m (gQomolangma). The main mountain ranges: Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir,Tien Shan, Hindu Kush, Kunlun, Great Caucasus, Altai, Sayan rangesVerkhoyansk and Chersky, Plateau: Tibet, Iranian, Armenian,Maloaziatske, class, Koryak, plateaus: Srednosybirske,Arabian, Dean, the largest plain: West Siberian, Turanian,Great Chinese, Mesopotamian, Indo-Hanhska.

<p>Over 60% of world population lives in Asia. Modern growthpopulation indicate that the era of population explosion in the regionleft behind. China, Japan, India conducted an active policyaimed at reducing the rate of natural population growth. Topgrowth rate (two times larger than the world) are observed today in South-West Asia (Oman, Yemen, etc.).. Problemsunemployment, poverty, nepysemnosti also associated with significantpopulation and its growth rate that is greater than growthGDP. The most unfavorable in this respect, countries in South andSouthwest Asia. Population density in the region is also high -three times higher than world rates. The biggest - in Indo-Hanhskiylowlands (Bangladesh - a country with the world&#39;s largest medium densitypopulation), the coastal regions of Japan and China, on o.Yava. There are also and virtually uninhabited hinterland of China and Mongolia.</p>
<p>In general in South and Southwest Asia dominatesyouth, children under 16 make up over 40% of the population. And at the same timeJapan Society has the most &quot;elderly&quot;. Sexual structurepopulation in Asia is characterized by a predominance of men: the1000 women accounted for 1,049 men. Asia - the least urbanized part ofworld, only a third of whose population lives in cities, but due to the largetotal population in China and India is Asia&#39;s livesalmost half of all citizens of the Earth.</p>
<p>Very complex and diverse national, linguistic and religiousthe population of the region. Here live the most numerous peoples of the world:Chinese hindustantsi, Bengali, Japanese, bihartsi, Punjabis, and yavantsiothers who speak over 800 languages</p>

<p>Nadra Asia is rich in various <strong>mineral resources</strong>: the region accounts for almost 70% of proven oil reserves (SaudiArabia - 25%, 9 - 10% - Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, UAE), 39% of the worldgas reserves (Iran, Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE ranked from second to fifthplace in the world in its reserves after Russia), one third of world reservescoal (the leaders of China are - first place in the world, India, Russia), significantreserves of thorium and uranium ore (China, India, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan). In Asia is more than 2 / 3 of world&#39;s reserves of tin and tungsten (China,Malaysia, Indonesia), third - nickel (China, Indonesia), chromium(Turkey, India, Philippines, Kazakhstan), manganese (India, China,Kazakhstan, Georgia), iron ore (China, India), bauxite (China, India,Indonesia), copper ore (China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia), gold(China, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan). Among non-metallic mineral raw materials should note the significant deposits of mica (India) and graphite (India, Sri Lanka,South Korea), potassium salt (Israel, Jordan), phosphorus (China,Kazakhstan, Jordan, Israel, Iraq).</p>

<p>For manufacturing GDP Asia is the world leader, and the pacegrowth compares to it can no region of the world.The leaders are Japan, China, India. For the production of GDP (at the ratenational currency), they rank respectively second, sixth andeleventh in the world. At the stage of post-development amongAsian countries are Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Cyprus,Israel and Bahrain. Industrial development reached India, China, newindustrialized countries &#39;second wave&#39;, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, the country -exporters of oil and gas. The least developed countries in the region (Afghanistan,Mongolia, Burma, Myanmar, etc.) are agricultural economics.</p>
<p>The fate of Asia is almost a third of world industrial production.Japan, China and India stand out among the countries of the region-scaleindustry development and range of industries. MostJapan&#39;s economy is extensive and newly industrialized countries &quot;firstwave. &quot; Gulf countries have a special structure of the economydominated sectors of the energy sector. Countries of the regionprovide global leadership in terms of oil, coal,iron ore, chromite, tin and tungsten ores. Among the areasmanufacturing allocated steelmaking, shipbuilding,mechanical engineering (production of household appliances, robotics,computers and components), production of cotton fabrics, garments,shoes.</p>
<p>Rapid growth of industrial production has not affected theagriculture, which occupied almost half the workforceregion. The first decade of XXI century. characterized by the production of almosthalf of world agricultural production in Asia. Mostpart of this production is consumed in the region. Asian countries areleaders not only in terms of production of basic food crops, but also for livestock animals. Only China produces a quarteragricultural products around the world.</p>

In the commodity structure of exports from South-WesternAsia is dominated by energy, industrial goods and ore raw material - instructure of East, South and Southeast Asia.</p>
