<p><strong>Mineral resources. </strong></p>
<p>Housekeeper for any state at the current stage of developmentof particular importance mineral resources. Mineralresources - natural substances of mineral origin that is used in economy as raw material or energy source. They are fundamentalmaterial production and use in all its branches.</p>

<p>Rate deepening pretty hard because it is impossibledetermine their value in the crust. Depending on the degree of exploration resource stocks differ from projected to explored. Ratingof mineral resources may vary over time. Throughscientific and technological advances are available to operate more and new fields.</p>
<p>Mineral resources (fuel, metal, engineering, constructionmaterials) because of them extracted raw material for various industrialproductions, often called <em>minerals</em></p>
<p>In the earth&#39;s crust has more than 200 kinds of mineral resources, includingproduce more than 160. Annually from the earth&#39;s interior producing over 120 billion tons various raw materials and fuel. Modern accommodation mineralsworld - is the result of long and complex process of geological development Earth. It is closely related to geological and tectonic structure.The natural accumulation of minerals known deposits, and accumulationdeposits - Pool minerals.</p>
<p>Mineral resources depending on the scope of their use of sharedfor: fuel and energy (coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, thoriumshale oil, etc.) ore (ore iron, foundry and refractory;ferrous, precious metals), non-metallic: a) steel (fluxes,refractory), b) mining and chemical (apatites, nepheline, rock, potassiumsalt, sulfur, sulfur kidney, barium, phosphorus), c) technical (Diamond,plaster, natural stone).</p>

<p>Fuel and energy resources of the world pretty significant, but they are to comprehensive and irretrievable. In their structure dominated by coal(Black and brown) - 75%. Its resources are concentrated in 3 thousand pools in75 countries mainly Northern Hemisphere. 2 / 3 of world reservescoal comes from four countries: USA, Russia, India and China.The most powerful in the world coalfield - Tunhuskyy, Lensky,Kuznetsk, Ruhr and Appalachian. ? world reserves of brown coalfalls on the U.S. and Russia. Top Bath - Lensky,Cannes-Achinsk, Cologne.</p>
<p>Oil and gas, due to similar geological origin in mostcases occur together. Today, the world&#39;s prospected over 600oil and gas basins. Over? world&#39;s oil is concentrated inSaudi Arabia. Almost? gas reserves accounted for Russia and the countriesNear and Middle East.</p>

<p>Essential stocks of nuclear fuel for nuclear power - uranium - Allocated U.S., Canada, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Ore (metal) resources</strong> their content in the Earth&#39;s crust is divided into two categories - common (content over 0.1%) and rare.</p>
<p>By using ore ores are divided into:</p>
<em><ol>
	<li>black, and alloying of refractory metals</li>
    <li>nonferrous metals,</li>
    <li>noble metals.</li>
</ol></em>
<p>The first group, which is the raw material for steel industry, areiron, manganese, chromium and nickel ore. The largest supplythem are South Africa, Australia, Brazil and Kazakhstan. Byore reserves of ferrous metals: copper, aluminum, polymetallic,Tin highlighted Australia, China, Russia. Precious metals -gold, silver and platinum - are concentrated in few countries. Leadingrole including the USA, Canada, South Africa, Russia,Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Metallic mineral resources</strong> have different origins and use. The largest reserves of potassium salt - raw materials forproducing acids, fertilizers - highlighted Canada, USA, Russia, Germany. For stocks brimstone leading position of the U.S.and Mexico, are also significant reserves in Poland, Ukraine and Russia. Phosphoriteslocated in the U.S., Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Apatity - Russia, China.</p>
<p>With numerous types of technical material by the greatest value specific physical properties have the resources of diamonds, asbestos,graphite. The bulk of diamonds is concentrated in three areas: inSouth Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia), in Australia andRussia (Yakutia). Asbestos reserves differ Russia (Ural), SouthAfrica, Zimbabwe and Canada. Graphite deposits are located in Russia, China,India, Sweden, Mexico.</p> 
<p>Provision of regional stocks of various types of mineralresources played a large role in forming and placing manyareas of the world economy. Use of mineral raw materials,the level of its involvement in production, the degree of technological and environmentaltreatment is an indicator of the economy. Economicallydeveloped countries tend to act as a consumer of mineralresources, and developing countries, their producers and exporters.</p>
<p>Land. One of the greatest wealth of any country isits land resources. Land - part of the earth&#39;s surfacesuitable for life and commercial activity. The territory alsocan be considered a kind of resource. It serves as the basis for spatiallocations of all branches of the main means of productionagriculture and forestry. The area has become a kind ofdeficit, especially in small room, but with numerouspopulation countries (Japan, Netherlands, Denmark).</p>

<p align="center"><strong>The problem of land shortage in India is very serious</strong></p>
<p>Today almost no remaining land that can absorb more.Along with the agricultural use is removed annually byvarious data, 6-7 million hectares of agricultural land throughwaterlogging, salinization, desertification, wind erosion. To pause This process should be made of measures of land protection.</p>

<p><strong>Water resources.</strong></p>
<p>Water - one of the most common and specific substances in nature.It is believed that life originated in water on our planet. Water resources -surface and ground water used or can beuse in economic activities.</p>

<p>Water resources are divided into fresh water land, includingsurface water (rivers, lakes, glaciers, artificial ponds, marshes) Yigroundwater, water seas and oceans.</p>
<p>In the water of the oceans for 71% of the world. With 31.4billion km3 volume of water of the hydrosphere, about 96.5% is the Ocean, 1,7% - of underground water, 1,7% - on ice, less than 0,01% - tosurface water (rivers, lakes, swamps).</p>

<p>First, demand is fresh water. The main source of freshwater for industry, agriculture, domestic needs were remaining river water. They are unevenly distributed. Topthe full resources of the river flow is concentrated in Asia and LatinAmerica, and the least endowed with this resource is Australia.</p>

<p>Woods - &quot;lungs&quot; of our planet. They play an important klimatotvirnu, water and soil protection, erosion and recreational role. Forestresources belong to the exhaustive, but renewable resources. Forests aresource of wood, used in construction and furnitureindustry. Wood also provides raw materials for the production of resin, cork,raw materials for synthetic fibers. In the woods hunting industry focusland, food (nuts, berries, mushrooms) resources.</p>
<p>Forests cover about 25% of the planet&#39;s surface. It is 41 million km2land. Wood stock - 330 billion m3. This figure is constantly changing:forest grows, it cut down. Unfortunately, the pace of forest clearing rates exceedingrecovery.</p>
<p>Conditionally all world forests are divided into two zones: the north, including Forests in temperate, subtropical zones, and south, coveringequatorial area, subekvatorialnoho and tropical zones.</p>
<p>Half of the forests is on the northern forest zone. It ismainly coniferous forests. A significant portion of this forest belongs to RussiaCanada, the United States. Among the northern forest zone is to provideFinland, Sweden, where the share of territory covered by forests is 60%.</p>

<p>The forests of the southern forest zone is mainly representedbroadleaf species. Within this zone, especially emitLatin America both in terms of forest cover and in termsstocks of wood. Recognized leader of Brazil. It ranks third inworld (after Russia and Canada) in terms of area under forest cover. Largeforested regions characterized by such a small area of the country, like Suriname(96,2%), Belize (92.1%), Guyana (83.8%). On the African continentlarge timber resources are concentrated in its central part. Hereemit such wooded country like the Democratic Republic of the CongoCameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea. Highest figureforested lands are marked and Pacific island countries (Fiji, SolomonIslands, Papua New Guinea).</p>
<p>Countries that have significant forest resources, are essentialsuppliers of wood on the world market. Therefore, these countries can be traced tendency to reduce the forest areas. The main cutting occurs in developing countries, of tropical America and Asia. In thesecountries are working hardly on lisovidtvorennya. Dangerouswas deforestation in mountainous areas. This leads to the mountaindesertification. In developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere - Finland, Sweden, Canada - reforestation than cutting.</p> 
<p>For 20 years the world has lost almost 200 million hectares of forests. It is so much But how much is the U.S. area east of the Mississippi. Together withdestruction of forests utrachayutsya unique landscapes disappear thousand speciesplants and animals. Extremely disastrous deforestation inAmazon and Indonesia.</p>
