<p>Oceans Throughout human history, play a &#39;vital role in human life. Natural resources of the oceans are divided into fourGroups:</p>
<ol>
	<li>resources contained in sea water;</li>
    <li>biological,</li>
    <li>Mineral,</li>
    <li>esursy thermal and mechanical energy.</li>

<p align="center"><strong>Ocean resources</strong></p>

<p>Every cubic kilometer of seawater contains about 35 million tons solids, including about 20 million tons of salt, 10 milliontons of magnesium, 31 tons of bromine, 3 tons of uranium, 0,3 t silver, 0.04 tons of gold.Total dissolved in seawater more than 70 chemical elements, ie 2 / 3 of the known world. Most of the water in sodium, magnesium, chlorine and calcium. However, only 16 items have a relatively high concentration of Yipractical value. Sea water - the only source of extraction of bromine, in water it is 8 times more than the earth&#39;s crust.</p> 
<p>Seawater using desalination technology can be used to replenish stocks of fresh water.</p>
<p>In the ocean are widely represented biological resources: 180 thousandspecies and 20 thousand species of plants. Large biomass of marine organisms - 36 billion tons. Her number tenfold increase from the equator topoles. This is because cold water organisms in larger sizes and faster play.</p>

<p>The economic importance are four groups of biological resources: fish,marine invertebrates (crabs, oysters, scallops, mussels, squid,octopus, cuttlefish), marine mammals (whales, walruses) and marinealgae. Most productive part of the ocean - shelf. Size of biological resources associated with the purity of water.</p>
<p>Over 85% of ocean biomass, the person who is onfish. The biggest catches in the Pacific Ocean and the Norwegian, Bering,Okhotsk and Japan Seas. Scientists believe that virtually all marine Algae can be used in food. Most of them are storing China, Japan, DPRK. But today the oceans to mankind, only 2% of the productsnutrition.</p>

<p>As the use of biological resources of the sea in many countriesthan their natural reproduction, in many countries, common type activity is the artificial breeding of fish, shellfish (oysters, mussels)crustaceans and algae, called mariculture. It is common in Japan, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, USA, Netherlands andFrance.</p> 
<p>Mineral resources of the oceans are divided into three groups.First, the resources of marine mineral resources (natural gas, oil, coal,iron ore, tin). Half the world&#39;s oil reserves account formarine deposit, which is a continuation mainland. The most famousoffshore deposits of the North Sea and the Persian Gulf.Perspective is the shelf of the Barents Sea and Sakhalin. Already 1 / 3Oil is produced from offshore fields. On the shelf as coal(UK, Canada, Japan, China), sulfur (USA). In addition,action of waves and currents of the destroyed coastal seabed, which issource of coastal placers (alluvial deposits), which contain diamondstin, gold, platinum, amber. Mineral resources can also beextract of the sea - building materials, phosphorite,iron-manganese nodules. Iron-manganese nodules with dimensions5-10 cm in diameter, their shape usually round or flattened.They dip at depths of 100-7000 m. Common in the Pacific are,Indian, Atlantic oceans. Total ore fields occupy 10% area Ocean Floor. Their production technologies have been developed but not yetare used widely. In areas of the Mid-ocean ridges inplaces of hot springs are concentrated significant reserves of zinc ore,lead, copper and other metals.</p>
<p>Alluvial diamond deposits known in the southwesterncoast of Africa. Here. At a distance of 1600 km in sand and gravel depositsshelf and coastal terraces appeared rich deposits of high qualitydiamonds, which stocks are about 40 million carats. AuricSands is on the sandy beaches of the Gold coast of Alaska, off the coast of Canada,Panama, Chile, Brazil, Turkey, Egypt, India and Australia. Platinum Sands known on the coast of Alaska, India, Australia and Brazil.High nodules can save up to 30 different elements, includingmanganese (25-30%), iron (15%), nickel (12%), copper (1,2%), cobalt (0,3%). Amber (solar stone) be brought waves of the Baltic andNorth Sea coast of Finland, Sweden, of Denmark, Norway,Netherlands and the eastern part of the British Isles.</p>
<p>Major is mechanical energy resources: hydropower potentialtide over potential of all rivers of the Earth, and wave energy 90 times more energy tides. Thermal energy resulting from differences temperatures of surface and deep water. This difference should be not less20? S. The maximum value of the tropical latitudes. However, modernlevel of science and technology still is not profitablethe mechanical and thermal energy of the oceans byexcluding energy and ebb tides. Tidal powerbuilt in France, USA, China and Russia.</p>

<p>The use of all ocean resources is accompanied bypollution. Particular threat is oil pollution andoil as a result of dumping of waste from ships, tanker accidents, losses during pohruztsi and rozhruztsi. Every year it gets into the ocean 10.5 milliontons of oil film formed on the surface of ocean water, inhibitsbiosynthesis process, violates the biological and energy ties. In addition, pollution of the oceans associated with the dumping of toxic andradioactive waste, testing different weapons.Also, significant amounts of pollution coming from coastal waters. Annuallythis way to the ocean gets over 320 million tons of iron salts, 6,5 million tonsphosphorus. Almost a third of fertilizers (30% potassium, 20% nitrogen, 2.5% phosphorus) are washed away by rain water and submitted in the sea and riversoceans. Sea water, saturated with nitrates - a favorable environment forunicellular algae, which, forming layers of huge (up to 2 mthick), hamper access of oxygen in the deep horizons. This causesstay one fish and other organisms. A significant number of ocean pollution associated with industrial and household waste. The problem ofoceanic waters applies to all countries, even those who do not havedirect access to the sea. Protection and rational usemarine environment is the subject of international cooperation.</p>
