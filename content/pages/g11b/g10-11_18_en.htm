<p><strong>World agriculture. </strong></p>
<p>With a long history of human civilization agricultureundergone rapid progress. Greatly expanded the number ofcrops and domestic animals, newtools, greatly intensified selection activities, widelybegan to apply fertilizers (organic first and thenmineral), chemical protection against pests, reclamation, successfullyapply the rotation.</p>
<p>Compared with other sectors and spheres of economic activityagricultural development major characteristic of the areaslong production process, lower materials consumption, mostlabor /.</p>
<p>Since most agricultural products is onecommodities, the prices on it are low. Therefore, industry needs a strong government support. Such assistance is constantly providing developed countries.For example, support for agricultural producers is amost significant items of expenditure in the budgets of the EU, USA.</p>
<p>Agriculture occupies an important place in all sectors withoutexception of countries. For a large group of developing countries, it is the basiseconomic system. His role in countries with significant populations(China, India, Indonesia), because agriculture guaranteesfood, respectively, and strategic security. In developed countries,share of agriculture in GDP is low, but itremains an important source of revenue.</p>
<p>In modern farming conventionally are two types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none outside none;">
	<li>For <strong>first</strong> type characterized by a high levelproductivity, intensity and efficiency. Such farmingknown trademark. This type is popular in most developed countries(Primarily European and Asian) and of the countriesdeveloping countries. Submitted by plant breeding and plantation tradebreeding. Effective labor is combined with manyinvestment.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>For <strong>second</strong> type of agriculturecharacterized by low productivity, intensity and efficiency.Such agriculture is called consumer. It is dominated bysignificant areas of developing countries, mainly inmost backward areas. All products are produced here is consumedplace. This type of economic activity is called natural. It is characterized by: a primitive reclaim a small proportionentered in fertilizers, the prevalence of manual labor, use ofdomestic animals as a traction force. </li>
</ul>

<p>Starting with 60 years of the twentieth century. in some developing countries,was the so-called &quot;green revolution&quot;, which covered the rangemeasures that eventually allowed to raise rural low-economy to a modern level. This applied also to view property ground. Land, who was in public ownership or possessionpeasant communities, passed into private ownership. Retrieving landprivate property, a farmer got to lay the ground at the bank.Banks have money to give farmers loans for acquisitionagricultural machinery and fertilizers. Of the costs of implementation&quot;Green revolution&quot; took the state, such as the implementation of expensiveprograms for land development, agricultural developmentmachinery, mineral fertilizers and means of combatingpests. On the budget was set large breeding centersbreeding new varieties of crops and breeds of domesticanimals. Some of them have gained international recognition - in Mexico (developing newwheat and corn), Philippines (rice output) in Colombia(Tropical fruit).</p>
<p>The modern world agriculture is difficult to imagine in isolation fromindustries that serve it. Their organizational association foundreflected in the formation <strong>agroindustrial complex (AIC)</strong>. Formation of a single complex of different sectors related toagriculture allowed to significantly reduce costs and dramaticallyimprove the production process.</p>
<p>APC have 30 years of the twentieth century. in the USA and was a responseagricultural businesses in the Great Depression 1929-1933, afterWorld War II and before the end. process of agriculture has captured all developed countries and some developing countries. But todayAIC has developed a few countries.</p>
<p>The structure of agriculture into three components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>industry, providing the means of production agriculture(Agricultural machinery, fertilizer production);</li>
    <li>own agriculture (direct production of agricultural products);</li>
    <li>industry, processing agricultural products (food, mixed feed industry, primary processing of raw materials for lightindustry) and those that serve agriculture (storage, transportation, trade, training, management).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the U.S., where agriculture has reached the highest degree of maturity, the ratio betweencomponents such as a percentage - 14:13:73. This suggests a minor roleAgriculture in the structure of modern agriculture. Currently workagricultural products without the presence of highly relatedareas virtually impossible.</p>
<p>Structure of three-level modern agriculture.</p> 
<ol start="1">
	<li><strong>At the macro level</strong>. At the macro level in the structure of agriculture are two major areas - <strong>plant</strong> and <strong>stockbreeding</strong>.<br>
    <p>Crop cultivation of various cropspart of which is fodder for livestock. In the southern countriesare often warm and humid climate, traditionally dominated by plant (In Europe it - Italy, Spain, Greece). Sometimes a significant roletradition. For example, in India for almost 5000 years old Hindu formedsolid vegetarian tradition according to which most peopledo not take meat. A similar tradition has formed in Japan, wherepeople prefer fish and seafood. In the Nordic countries,Conversely, more developed animal (Finland, Sweden, Denmark,Germany). In the U.S., the ratio between crop and livestockroughly the same.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mezolevel</strong>. <p>At a level withinPlant distinguish separate groups of crops:grains, technical, other food (vegetables, fruits) and feed.</p>
<p>The leading groups of the remaining grain. In recent years,With the increase in output of livestock products has increased proportion of forage crops.</p>
<p>In the animal at this level has traditionally allocated: cattle, pigs, sheep and other industries.</p></li>
<li><strong>Micro</strong>. At the micro level in crop production in eachgroup cultures distinguish the relationship between different cultures, andanimal - between different areas of each field (eg,cattle produce milk and meat areas).</li>

<p><strong>Crop.</strong></p>
<p>The leading group of crops are cereals. Theycover about half of all arable land. Different types of crops can be grown in all without exception natural areas, where possiblein all crops and crop rotations, which is important for crop production.With the optimal combination of proteins, fats and carbohydrates are zernviimportant food and forage crops. In addition, productiongrain effectively - to grow a quintal of grain is consumedmore than 1 man-hours of labor.</p>
<p>The gross production of grain for a long time occupied a leading positiondeveloped countries. With the &quot;green revolution&quot; in the last decadesome developing countries, were able to quickly increase productioncereals (China, India, Indonesia, Brazil).</p> 
<p>Cereals are of great strategic importance. Usuallyconsider if the country produces grain at least 1 000 kg / person, it provided not only meat but also major types of animal products.Most developed countries are provided with grain: Canada, Australia, USA,France and Argentina. In the crowded countries of Asia and Africa thisrate is very low</p>.

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Cereals</strong></p>

<p>To estimate the level of development of grain farming in the countryused the average yield of grain crops. Hishighest values (50-75 kg / ha) typical of developed countries andfor some countries with intensive agriculture (Japan,U.S., South Korea, Egypt). The lowest yields - in the poorestAfrican countries (1-10 kg / ha).</p>
<p>The major crops - wheat, rice and corn, whichcalled &quot;three loaves of mankind&quot;. Gross harvest them the same. Bywheat acreage nearly twice the area dominated by rice, which can give 2-3, and sometimes four crops a year.</p>
<p>Wheat is grown in temperate and subtropical climatic zones. InNorthern hemisphere climatic zones of the area greater than in the South,so here gather more harvest. World leader in manufacturingwheat are China, India, USA, Russia, France, Germany, Ukraine, Canada. </p>
<p>Rice is grown mostly in Asian countries with monsoon climate.Among the other regions of significant production of rice are Brazil, USA.</p>

<p>The largest corn harvest traditionally collect the U.S., Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina). Much smaller role of Europeancountries (France, Italy, Romania, Hungary). In recent years, increasedproduction of corn some Asian countries, especially China, India.</p>
<p>Gross harvest of barley and millet crops, oats and rye significantly lowerthan wheat, rice and corn. The largest gathering of the country&#39;s barley croptemperate and subtropical climatic zones of the Northern Hemisphere (Canada, Russia, Germany, Spain, France). Barley - feed primarily, but notfood crops. In addition, some countries (Germany, Czech Republic), he is the raw material for beer production. Millet, sorghum, dzhovar, badzhra, rahi -are important food crops for most African countries andsome Asian countries. In the U.S., Latin America it is widelyused in the production of fodder. Major crops milletcrops are harvested in India, Nigeria, the USA, Mexico and China.</p>
<p>Oats and rye spread about in the same regions and countries where and barley. The gross collection of oats in the world emit Russia, Canada, USA, Australia, Germany, rye - Russia, Poland, Ukraine, China. Oatmainly forage crops, corn - food. With rye baked blackbread. Traditionally, the world famous black bread Poland, Germany,Denmark, Russia, Sweden.</p>

<p>In global trade usually gets no more than 10% grain.Since the grain is largely strategic goods, each countrytrying to produce it themselves. In recent years largegrain exporters are the USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, the countryEuropean Union, Australia, China, major importers - countriesLatin America, North Africa, South and WestSouth-East Asia.</p>
<p>For each region of the world characterized by a set of basic grainscultures: for Europe - wheat, barley, rye, for Asia - rice, wheat,for America - corn, wheat, for Australia - wheat, for Africa -corn, sorghum, millet.</p>

<p>Important place in the modern world agricultural production is <strong>industrial crops</strong>. Technical considered crops that require further industrial processing. These include <strong>oil, sugar, tonic, fibrous, kauchukonosni culture</strong>.</p>
<p>Among the leading position of the oil, soy, canola, sunflower and peanut.</p>

<p>The major soybean growing areas in the world are countries with largerainfall in the summer. Homeland soybean consider China. But major crops over the past decades collected in the United States. Forcefullyincreasing production of soybeans Latin America (Brazil,Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia) and India. Soya is an important culture forfodder production due to larger protein content.</p>
<p>The main world producers of rape - European countries (France,Germany, Poland) and Canada, peanuts - India, China, USA, Brazil,Argentina, Nigeria, sunflower - Argentina, Ukraine, Russia, USA, France, oil palm - South-East Asia, Gulf of Guinea andOceania, oil - the Mediterranean (especially Spain, Italy,Greece, Turkey).</p>
<p>The most popular among sugar crops have received only two -sugar cane and sugar beet. Sugar cane was cultivated in V Art. in Bengal, from where it spread around the world. But it is nowhere morenot well settled, as in Latin America. Sugar beet wasdomesticated much later. The first sugar beet received inGermany in late eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. main sugarculture was considered sugar beet. At this time sugar producers weredeveloped countries. Further production and moved to countries thatdeveloping countries by the proportion of sugarcane has increased dramatically (up to70%). Sugar production from sugar cane was more effective than thatdue to its high yield. The maximum yields of sugar cane collect Brazil and India. The south of the country specializing inproducing sugar from sugar cane, and the north - from sugar beet.Only two countries (China and the U.S.) producing sugar from both cultures.The powerful sugar exporters are Brazil, Cuba, Australia, Thailand,France, Germany, major importers - Russia, China, Japan, USA,India, UK.</p>

<p>Important <strong>tonic cultures</strong> are coffee, cocoa and tea. For each of these cultures transition from an historical &quot;homeland&quot; the new location. Yes, the birthplace of coffee was Africa, and large modern area of cultivation was Latin America. The largest harvest of coffeecollected in two countries - Brazil and Colombia. Recently, fastincreases the total coffee export duties and Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia)African (especially C</p>
<p>Brazil and Colombia, which most coffee is grown, hardly compete each other. Brazil cultivates regular coffee that is grown onplantations outdoors and gather combine. This coffee has a bitter tasteand black. Colombia cultivated elite varieties of coffee. They are grown inthe shade of tall trees and collect manually. This coffee has a sour tastearoma.</p>
<p>Homeland cocoa consider Latin America (chocolate drinkstill used ancient Mayan tribe), and of large manufacturersare African countries (C</p>
<p>Tea was cultivated in China, which now consist of its mostvarieties. Over 100 years of the largest producers of tea is a former British colonies: India, Sri Lanka, Kenya. Recently, significantly increasedproduction of tea, Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam, Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;Homeland&quot; of tobacco, which are considered the drug culture, isLatin America, from where it spread around the world. The largestChina became a producer of tobacco. It is far behind India,Brazil, USA. U.S. gradually gross yield of tobacco, while countries that developing countries - are increasing. Large crops of tobacco collectMediterranean countries (Turkey, Greece, Italy) and some countriesAfrica (Zimbabwe, Malawi).</p> 
<p>Go to the tonic can be enrolled and drug culture thatwidely used in medicine. Major suppliers of these culturesare Asian countries - Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran (the country&#39;s &quot;Goldencrescent &quot;), Myanmar, Thailand, Laos (&quot; Golden Triangle &quot;) andsome Latin American countries, primarily Colombia. Governments of allcivilized countries have a fight against the illicit traffic in narcoticplants.</p>
<p>Among the most common rubber plant rubber tree. Its historical&quot;Homeland&quot; is Brazil, but at the end of the nineteenth century. leading position inproducing latex captured South-East (Thailand,Indonesia, Malaysia) and South (India, Sri Lanka) Asia. Comparativelysmall latex production are African countries (C</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Technical (oil and fiber) culture</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fibrous culture</strong> - One of the most important amongindustrial crops. These include cotton, flax dovhunets, hemp,abacus, jute, sisal. Cotton was cultivated in Latin America. Ontoday the largest producers of cotton are Asian countries (China,India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Syria) and the USA, Brazil,Greece. Egypt grows cotton satin and became its largestsupplier to the world market. Most serednovoloknystoyi cottonU.S. exports (30%), China, Pakistan, Central Asia.The largest cotton importers Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong andEuropean countries.</p>
<p>World leaders to produce long-fibred flax - European countries(France, Russia, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Belgium), abaca -Philippines, Jute - India, Bangladesh, sisal - East Africa(Tanzania, Kenya) and Latin America (Brazil).</p>
<p>It is important to growing food crops such aspotatoes, vegetables and fruits. Currently, the gross collection of major potatopositions in the world are China, Russia, India, USA, Ukraine, Germany,Poland, Belarus, Netherlands, Britain waged. Most of potato per capita growing population of Ireland, Belarus, Poland, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The gross world leaders gathering vegetables are large countries withpopulations and favorable climatic conditions (China, India,USA) per capita - Mediterranean countries:Turkey, Italy, Greece). Major crops of tomatoes collected in the U.S.China, Italy, Turkey, cabbage - in China, South Korea, Japan,Onion - China, India, USA.</p>
<p>World leader in fruit are the countries with favorableclimatic conditions - China, India, Brazil, USA. Most of the fruits ofcollected per capita in the Mediterranean. The gross collectionapples emit China and the U.S., grapes - Italy, France, Spain, USA, Oranges - Brazil, USA, lemons - Mexico, Argentina, India, Iran,Mandarin - Japan, bananas - India, China and Latin American countries Mango - India. An absolute leader (80%) of exports of orangejuice (frozen concentrate in the form) are Brazil, Banana - Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia. Rapidly increasing production and exportswine Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Algeria, Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Livestock.</strong></p>
<p>In the animal is divided into four main areas - farming,pigs, sheep, chickens, and others - horse breeding,verblyudarstvo, olenyarstvo, sericulture.</p>Among the individual regions of the world most numerous cattleCattle are Asia, Latin America, Africa. In addition to the cows herebred buffalo, zebu, vatusi. Productivity of cattle in countriesdeveloping small. Cattle in Europe and North America are few, but highly productive. Developedcountries produce the bulk of the global beef and milk.  <p align="center">

<p align="center"><strong>Stockbreeding</strong></p>

<p>Intensive dairy or beef cattle are characterized mainly forsmall farms, and extensive cattle ranching - large farms.Large livestock farms are typical for countries that have significantgrassland area (USA, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Brazil,Argentina).</p>
<p>Most developed pig - in China. Traditionally, many pigsbred in the U.S., Europe (Germany, Spain, Russia, Poland,France, the Netherlands) and Latin American countries (Brazil, Mexico).</p>
<p>Distribution of sheep and livestock distribution kozivnytstva resembles a largecattle. In developing countries, most sheep are raised inChina, India, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and goats - in India, Pakistan,Iran, some African countries. This low-yield stock, givessmall amount of wool, down, meat. In developed countries (Australia,New Zealand, United Kingdom, South Africa) stock few,but gives a lot of wool.</p>
<p>In most poultry breeding hens, to a lesser extent - geeseducks, turkeys. Poultry produces eggs and meatindustrial basis. Of the total world poultry 40%occurs in Asia, where leaders are China, Japan, India, Indonesia. OnEuropean countries accounted for 17%. Most poultry is grown in France,Great Britain, Italy and Romania. In North America accounted for 11%(About 1 / 2 U.S., 1 / 4 in Mexico), in South America - 10% (2 / 5 inBrazil) to Africa - 9% (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, South Africa).</p>
<p>Great importance in the diet of the population play a seafoodespecially fish. World Fisheries an annual 75 million tons of fish and another 20 million tons get artificial breeding of fish. 2 / 3 of marine fish produce in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of America and East Asia, and 1 / 4 - in the AtlanticOcean off the coast of Europe and North America.The most numerous herd of horses in China, Mexico, Brazil, the largestcamels bred South-West Asia and North Africareindeer - in Russia, Canada, United States (Alaska) and Scandinaviancountries.</p>
