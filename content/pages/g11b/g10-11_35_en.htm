<p><strong>Relief</strong> country quite diverse. Westernpart is located within Central Asia. In the south-west -highest in the world Tibet Plateau (a combination of raised to 4000 -4500 m high plains and ridges 5000 - 6000 m). Highlands obramlyayetsyahigh mountain systems: the south and west - the Himalaya and Karakoram, in the north and east - Kunlun, Nanshan and Shito-Tybetski mountains. Onnorth and northwest of the country are large desertPlain: Tarymska, Dzungaria, Alashan, Gobi, Takla Makan-. Eastpart of China is located within East Asia, where the mountains do not exceed3000 m. In the north-east - raising large and small and Khingannorthern part of the Manchus-Koreyskyh mountains that separate the lowlandsSantszyan and Sunlyao. South - heavily eroded Loess Plateau and the plateauOrdos, mountains Tsynlin, Sychuanskaya basin, Yunnan-Huychzhouske Highlands Nanlin and mountains. Along the Yellow Sea and East China stretchesGreat China plain.</p>
<p>In the western part of China <strong>climate</strong> sharplycontinental, temperate highlands of Tibet - cold, in the easternof China - monsoon, north of the mountains Tsynlin - moderate, betweenTsynlin mountains and Nanlin - subtropical in the southern provinces of the country - tropical. Rainfall ranges from 50 mm (Gobi Desert) to2500 mm (east coast) a year, snow is everywhere,allowing year-round grazing. In autumn there are typhoons. In southerncountry&#39;s climatic conditions allow the cultivation of two crops a year.Western areas lie in the internal flow, in the east thereextensive network of rivers: Yangtze, Yellow River, with tributaries Sytszyan withmonsoon regime of the summer floods and used for irrigation andshipping.</p>
<p>Plains of eastern parts of China are mainly processed. Only 10%the country under cultivation, while China ranked fourth inworld&#39;s arable land area, but per capita, this figure in the worstworld - 0,07 hectares. The mountains are mixed and coniferous forests in temperatenorth, subtropical broad-leaved tropical and stacked - in the south. </p>

Marketeconomy in China is built under the leadership of the Communist Party (CCP)based on the five-year plans. Economic reforms began with the Agriculturalsector, where farmers were given the opportunity to rent long termland and equipment. Given the high economic growtheconomy has an extensive character. GDP per capita in 2004reached $ 1280. The fate of foreign investment in the country is very high,almost 80% of all foreign investors in ethnic Chinese (&quot;huatsyao&quot;), whichliving abroad. China undisputed second place after the U.S.volume of attracted foreign investments. One of the characteristicsChina&#39;s economic reforms is their evolutionary nature and lack ofelements of &quot;shock therapy&quot;.</p>
<p>With plans for the CPU to 2010 the country must catch up the U.S. totalGDP, but a number of experts believe this figure is exaggerated, because at this timesome estimates China&#39;s economy is 45% capacity of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>To facilitate structural change China develops its own education system,facilitates the training of students in kordonom.yu especially in the U.S. and Japanencourage imports of technologies that develop progressivesectors (software, newmaterials, telecommunications industry, biotechnology, healthHealth). In the area Haydian (north of Beijing) was established ChineseSilicon Valley. Intensification of production and by bringingResults: The unemployment rate reaches 20%.

<p>The structure <strong>GDP</strong> Agriculture is - 10.6 % Of the cost, industry - 49.2%, services - 40.2%. Employmentpopulation is as follows: agriculture occupied 43%, industry - 25% in services - 32% of laborresources.</p>
<p>Indicators of the changes in the structure of GDP indicate that the valueagriculture in the country is gradually reduced, industry and service sector has been a growing pace.</p>
<p><strong>Industry</strong>. The country ranks first in the world volume of coal: Province Chance (deposit Datong), Heibei(Kayluan), Liaoning (Fushun, Fuxin), fifth in terms of oil production:Heilongjiang Province (Daqing field gives one-third of Chinese oil)perspective is also a shelf and Liaodong bays Bohayvanskoyi Yellow Sea. Enterprises tend to refining centers of consumption of finishedproducts or major sea and river ports (Shanghai, Tianjin,Nanjing). On the basis of deposits of coal in China (Shanxi, Fusin,Fushun), as in other mining areas of the world (Russia, USA,Kazakhstan) distribution and a high enough level of development wasvuhleenerhohimichnyy cycle. It includes extraction, enrichment andcoking coal, production of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers, receivingbenzene, naphthalene and other products of organic synthesis.</p> 
<p>The country&#39;s largest iron ore basin (Anshan) is located in the province Lyaolin. China - the largest exporter of tungsten ores.</p>
<p>By producing electricity, China is second only to USA. Greatof the energy produced by TPP, 3 / 4 of which run on coal.Increasing importance in the energy balance of HPS. Planned introduction of exploitation of the world&#39;s largest hydroelectric &quot;Hechzhouba&quot; power of 17,700 MW.Developing nuclear power.</p>
<p>The country ranks first in the world of cast iron and steel plantsthey tend to production areas of coking coal andiron (Anshan, Fushun, Baotou, Wuhan, Shenyang). Obsoletesequipment and manual labor leads to the fact that a significant proportion of steelhas low quality because China imports of finished steel and steel.A giant plant that produces high-quality steel, built inBaoshan. The plant focuses on imported raw materials.</p>

<p>China takes first place and the production of mineral fertilizers (Chongqing, Shanghai), but most of them have low quality, because agriculture country depends on imported products. Chemical companies of the countrytend to refining centers and major ports.</p>
<p>Most competitive products are shoes and clothes. Textileindustry of China - the first in the world, because export production industryrepresented in most countries. Textile companyspecializing in the manufacture of clothing made of synthetic fabrics.Enterprises of this sector are scattered throughout the country, but most largelocated in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Harbin. Chinese exportproducts sold in North America, Japan, Western Europe has high quality standards. Production facilities are located in coastal provinces, which are concentrated numerous branches of foreign corporations. In northern and inland areas based multiplehandicraft companies producing counterfeit products leadingbrands of the world of low quality and price assigned to the markets of Russia, the CIS and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Light industry is focused on the country&#39;s cheap labor,is located in the major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and Beijing.All City is the biggest center of silk industry.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture. </strong>In agriculturecountry dominated by crop production. Half of the arable land - land irrigation.The main agricultural products: rice, wheat, potatoes, tea(Batkivshyna - Yunnan Province, the second largest in the world productionafter India), millet, barley, apples, sweet potatoes, oilseeds (soybeans,peanuts), cotton, tobacco, jute, sugar cane, sugar beets, etc..Developed vegetable (grown more than a hundred kinds of vegetables), fruit, viticulture.
