<p><strong>World Economy</strong> - A set of nationaleconomies of individual countries. Since they all have general andspecific features of development, the world economy as a graduateeconomic processes at several levels: the global economy as a whole,group of countries, individual countries, major regions within countries.</p>
<p>Now the world economy encompasses more than 240 national economies, dozens of influential international organizations, thousands of largetransnational corporations. Thus, the world economy -global system of farm and non-State entities relatedinternational division of labor and interacting in various forms. Featureworld economy is its integrity, provided that the mechanisminternational relations, support the activities of international organizationsand powerful transnational corporations. Modern World Economyhas a complex structure: on the development of multilevel, multi-by spatial organization, asymmetric - due to distortedrelations.</p>
<p>Define a clear date of the global economy is difficult. If starting point to consider beginning the commercial activityIn general, it is necessary to start from the rise of tribal communities. If leadback to the start of the global economy as an integralorganism, the starting point would be the era of large geographicaldiscoveries (XV-XVI centuries.). During this era took accumulationinitial capital for the future of industrialization in Europecountries attracting significant overseas territories into a singleeconomic mechanism.</p>
<p>Formation of the global economy - a long historical process thatcan be divided into stages that are connected with certain events in historyhumanity. Among the important stage of which include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>separation of plant breeding, the conditions for the emergence of barter;</li>
    <li>separation of crafts from agriculture, formationmarket and trading activities and as a result - the emergence of privateproperty, separating the city from rural areas;</li>
    <li>world market after formation epoch of great geographicaldiscovery (late XV - XVII in the middle.) market expansion throughdevelopment of transport, including sea;</li>
    <li>transition from manual labor to machine production, developmentindustry and facilitate trade relations between countries(End of XVII? XIX centuries).</li>
    <li>expansion of railway network, which contributed to the internal connectionpart of the continent and the strengthening of the intracontinental relationships (second half of the XIX century)..</li>
</ul>
<p>So at the end of the nineteenth century. world economy was formed, but its development continues today.</p>Accordingly, in the history of the world economy entails the following stages.<ul style="list-style: none inside none;">
	<li><strong>Pryvlasnyuvalne economy.</strong> Most longstage, which covers the early (Paleolithic, 2 million years ago - up to 10 thousandBC) and middle (Mesolithic, 10 - 5 thousand years BC) stoneever. While the first man cared about getting food and thenmajor types of economic activities were hunting, fishing,gathering wild fruits and berries, beekeeping. At this stage the man waspart of nature and practically do not cause noticeable damage to it. Forsocial order characterized by birth community with equality of all its members. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Agrarian economy.</strong> This is the second periodphase, which includes several historical eras - from the new stone age(Neolithic, 5.3 thousand years BC) to the new time (late fifteenth century - the middleEighteenth century.). The main objective of getting people remained food, butthey are not excluded from wildlife, and organized manufactured.Accordingly there is a new kind of human activity - production.The leading industry is agriculture. Crafts and trade,born, only served it. For a social system characterized by inequality and exploitation of man by man, dominion and slaveryfeudalism. Active Human activities contributed to the aggravationenvironmental situation. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Industrial&#39;ne economy.</strong> Beginning stagecomes at a time the English Industrial Revolution (70-80 years eighteenth century.) and the end - with 70 years of the twentieth century. The leading branch of this stage isindustry. The development of commodity production orientation was determinedmanufacturing products for its sales and profit.Businesses always seek to reduce the price of production, finding resources as own country and others. Under the country objectively divided into colonies that supply resources and metropolis that these resourcesprocessing. Expansion of production of goods and services leads toof consumer society. Social system - capitalism.Intensive development of the economy leads to a significant deteriorationenvironmental situation.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Postidustrialne economy.</strong> This stagestarted in the 70 years of the twentieth century. and continues today. Attribute -predominant development of the service sector and agriculture andindustry lose their positions. Among service industriesleading role played by financial transactions. The largest gainsreceived in the financial market, particularly in such sectors asMonetary, credit, investment. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This situation is possible due to a high leveltechnological and technical equipment of agricultural andindustrial production.</p>
<p><strong>International geographical division of labor.</strong></p>
<p>World economy - a body of economic interdependenceall countries and peoples, based on international division of laborfinancial-credit and transport and communication systems.</p>
<p><strong>International geographical division of labor</strong> - A peculiar engine of world economy. It has emerged in parallel with tradeproduction, which replaces the natural. Because no one country orterritory, even the most developed, fail completely independentlyprovide conditions for efficient production of all goods and services.History of the World - a history of divisionwork.</p>
<p>Thus, the international division of labor - the highest level of developmentsocio-territorial division of labor between countries, a coreeconomically beneficial specialization of individual countries and the exchange of productsspecified quantity and quality. Specialization determinenatural-geographic, socio-economic, scientific, technical, historical, national factors that make it possible to produce specific types ofgoods and services, or the same goods and services, but cheaper orhigher quality.</p>
<p>WFP development necessitates increased productivityand lower costs of production. WFP provides implementation advantagescountry in the exchange of a difference between international and domestic price of exported goods and services, and domestic savingscosts of reducing domestic production by usecheap imports.</p> 
<p>The basis of division of labor is the international specialization of production, whichdeveloped on four main areas: cross-sectoral, subject,technological and podetalna.</p>
<p><strong>Inter-industry specialization</strong> covers productsprimary sector (mainly agriculture and miningindustry). Leading countries in world production and oil exportnatural gas, iron ore - examples of inter-sectoral specialization.</p> 
<p><strong>Subject specialization</strong> characteristic of the manufacturing industry, ie production and export of finished products (cars, marine vessels, plastics).</p>
<p><strong>Technological specialization</strong> resulting&quot;Territorial gap&quot; of a chain in manufacturingcertain product (eg, aluminum: alumina produced in countries whereextract bauxite, aluminum and metal - in countries with largeElectricity power).</p>
<p><strong>Podetalna specialization</strong> - Is cooperating, sharingproduction of specific products. The best of the international cooperating in engineering, chemical industry.</p>
<p><strong>Areas of the country</strong> - Is it a specific &quot;card&quot;. Yes, Japan is associated with us in an electronic technique, France - withfashion, perfume, wine, Kuwait - of oil, Cuba - with sugarreed, Switzerland - with banks, cheese, watches.</p>
<p>International division of labor is the result of centuries of developmentproductive forces, strengthening of national and international division of labor cooperation based on material interests, growthworld market production, development of world populationeconomic relations, regional integration and internationalizationproduction and globalization of world economy.</p>
<p>Regional integration is reflected in the formation of neighborhoodeconomic grouping certain level: the free trade area, customsunion, common market or economic union. The effectachieved through the reduction or complete abolition of customs duties and quotasspecialization of individual countries and territories in the production of a certain typeproducts and increased competition between business entities.</p> 
<p><strong>FTA</strong> easier conditions of mutual trade between partner countries. Example: NAFTA, which includes U.S., Canada, Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Customs Union</strong> implies acceptance of the requirements inTrade with countries outside it. Example: Andean Group:Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.</p> 
<p><strong>Common market</strong> provides a single marketgoods, capital, labor Yi. Example: Mercosur: Brazil,Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Union</strong> - The most mature form of integration, It is characterized by development of a uniform policy, anational economic bodies, the maximum reliefperception of the state borders. Economic Union in the world until one -European Union (EU).</p>
<p>Today, the processes of integration groupings cover allregions of the world - Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America,Africa. In economically developed regions of the world communities are not so much but here they are the most mature.</p>
