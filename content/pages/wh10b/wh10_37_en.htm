He had great musical ability, butschool mathematics teacher opened it a tendency to natural and physical sciences.While studying at the universities of Munich and Berlin, M. Planck chose physicsthough one of its professors argued that there already open anything. M. Planckfascinated by the study of phenomena of heat, mechanical energy and energy conversion.He believed that electromagnetic radiation is not continuousflow and quantity. Their Einstein later called quanta. Thus, laborM. Planck marked the birth of quantum theory. It was a real revolution inphysics. For the discovery of energy quanta scientist 1919 was awardedNobel Prize.</span></p>

Planck wasexecuted in 1944 for participation in the assassination of Hitler.</span></p>

<p class="txt112" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">Merit scholar highly appreciated. M. Plank was a membermany foreign academies, including the USSR, was elected asA. Einstein, a member of the Scientific Society. Shevchenko, which waspredecessor of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The company, which he headed for war,renamed the Max Planck Society.</span></p>

At school he did not likecramming and excessive discipline. Finding ability in mathematics and physics,read a lot yourself. My father wanted to see the son of an engineer, but he atentrance exams in Zurich &quot;failed&quot; and had all the samefinish high school. In Switzerland, Einstein renounced Germancitizenship.</span></p>
