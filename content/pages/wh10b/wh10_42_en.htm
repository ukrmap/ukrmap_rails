<p class="head3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">1.Causes of policy &quot;appeasement&quot; </span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In those conditionspreservation of peace meant Versailles-Washington system, which, despiteits shortcomings, ensuring relative stability and recognized the force of law. Thisit contains the principle of prevention of international crises. He anticipatedcollective action against the aggressor through the League of Nations. Collective could not repel?mechanism failed. Why?</span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">First of allbecause the ability of Western countries for collective action against aggressors droppedthrough the aggravation of mutual rivalry in search of ways to overcome economiccrisis. In addition, the economic situation and distract public attentionpoliticians on internal problems. Solving them was a priority.</span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Collectiveresistance needed to use a variety of aggressors, including powermethods. Protecting peace in those conditions required courage, will and readiness to certainlosses. However, the very idea is for people who have just survived the war, seemedsinister. The public in England and France was set strongly againstuse of force. China, Ethiopia seemed too distant to perceive theirthreat to European security. Understanding the integrity and indivisibility of the world does notwas inherent to the then public opinion. Such sentiments have found theirreflected in policy &quot;appeasement&quot; that led the country topassivity and excessive caution.</span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The advent of Hitlerto power was not immediately accepted by turning in politics Germany. Longtime it saw only a strong national leader who sought to restorefor German justice. Plans of the Nazis first division of the worldevaluated as a tribute to nationalist rhetoric and not taken seriously.The leaders of Britain and France saw no reason to change policy, whichactively introduced in the 20&#39;s and was aimed at the gradual weakeningburden of Versailles. It becomes clear lack of response and EnglandFrance of Germany, though they wore open and audacious characterviolated a principle of international law: the contract mustfollowed.</span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Nazism inGermany has not had time to show his predatory face. European countries were nothorrors of occupation. Hitler seemed to be a politician with whom you agree.</span></p>

<p class="txt108" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Noteworthy to say about the U.S. position. The crisis there chainedpublic attention to domestic issues. Increase voltage generated in the worldU.S. desire to stay away from everything in his &quot;Americanfortress. After the adoption in 1935, the law of neutrality richestcountry in the world, with significant resources and ability to influence world politics,like it fell out. This dramatically increased the chances of the aggressors.</span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Moststrong supporter of the policy of appeasement was the Prime MinisterUK in the 1937-1940 biennium N.Chem-berlen. In his view, the dangerwas not in the aggressive intentions of Germany, and in the wrong estimation of the international crisis.He believed that the First World War arose because of certain great powerstime lost control of events resulting in local conflict escalatedin World War II. To avert this danger, to savecontacts with all parties to an international conflict and solve existingproblem based on mutual concessions.</span></p>

<p class="txt108"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In fact, Hitlerfocus on new and nahabnishi claim. They became the objects of discussion and allhappy ending territorial claims in Germany.</span></p>

England andFrance betrayed Czechoslovakia, a country of which it was associated withVersailles system, one of the few real democracies in Europe. Cynicalwas a link to the right of nations to self-determination, the right of Germans, Hungarians,Poles to unite with their motherland, because in 1919 Paris isright were sacrificed and strategic antynimetskym antyuhorskyminterests, as in 1938 offering policy &quot;appeasement.&quot;Messenger Czechoslovakia in England after signing the agreement said the SovietAmbassador: &quot;They sold me into slavery Germans, once Negroes ever sold inUSA! &quot;</span></p>
