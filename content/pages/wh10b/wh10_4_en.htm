France became a creditor ofdebtor. But the main debtor France - Russia rescinded all of itsobligations. The most popular slogan in the country was: &quot;The Germans allpay! &quot;French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau was determined torealize this motto and sought to weaken Germany by any means. Hesaid: &quot;In Europe, 20 million Germans unnecessary. So they had tobecome less, at least adjacent to the French territories. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Forthese intentions at</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">turalhoped to regain Alsace and Lorraine</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="RU"> prevent the unification of Austria andGermany, a German buffer state on the left bank of the River Rhine</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, PassGerman states of Belgium, of Denmark, Poland</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="RU"> etc. It was predicteda secret agreement between France and Tsarist Russia.
