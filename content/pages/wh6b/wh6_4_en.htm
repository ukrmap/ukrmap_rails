During this time, developed agriculture andcattle. Food and handicraft products in those placesEarth, where they had a favorable climate and fertile land, has reached such a number thatgranted the possibility to feed more people. The emergence of crafts - pottery andWeaving - gave new signs of life of primitive man. Further developmentneed of increasing the number of different implements. Stone, asmaterial for manufacturing, no longer satisfy the new needs of humanity. And thenman began to look for, what to replace it. The natural material that had otherproperties than stone, wood, bone, has been copper. In primitive times itoccurrence on the ground in pure form. The period when he learnedhandle and use copper, called copper-stone age, or <b>Bronze Age(V</b>–<b>IV thousand BC). </b>At first, people tried to handlecopper as well as stone - beat.

First metal vyplavlyaly in those furnaces inwhich burnt pottery. Later they built a special long steelfurnace. It is unlikely that the transition from ductile to melting was accidental, since copper mayrozplavylas was required temperature is 700-800 C °. Afterwards she startedsmelt from ore. In nature copper ores in combination with small stones lookbluish color. Ancient metallurgy could put up a stone ovenand see that most of the stone disappeared, and he got in pure copperform. Perhaps, as the man opened the way extraction of copper from ore. Scientistsbelieve that in this way the metal began to receive in different places almostsimultaneously.
