<p class="rvps2"> complex of four distribution maps paleogeographical land and sea in different geological periods reflects the most interesting phases of ancient Earth history. Then have formed the main tectonic structures, but did not stop movements of the earth&#39;s crust, and continued raising of lowering the ground surface. As a result, certain areas of land zatoplyuvalysya or raised from the seabed with those sediments that settled to the bottom for a long geological time.</p> 
<p class="rvps2"> <em> comparison of these maps with a map </em> <em> Geological structure </em> helps to understand the conditions under which postponed powerful deposits of coal, why in the Dnieper-Donets basin is thickness of Cretaceous marine sediments, Paleogene and Neogene blocked sand, and the northwest of the overlap is not why so many in the Black Sea deposits of limestone (it was a warm shallow sea, where many settled shell remnants of animals).</p>
