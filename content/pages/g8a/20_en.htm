<p class="rvps2"> With maps can be traced zonal distribution pattern of soil <em> </em>. In northern Ukraine dominated sod-podzol soil (including gleyed that formed under conditions of wetlands), to the west in the plains - gray forest soils and ashed black, further east - a complex of forest soils and typical black earth rehradovanymy that alternate with soils formed under forest vegetation (gray ashed). South of the forest-steppe zone soils complexes clearly distinguished types of desert soil complexes that define its boundaries pidzonalni: ordinary black - northern steppe, southern black - middle steppe chestnut soils - southern desert. Some large complexes of soils associated with mountain regions of the Carpathians (brownsoil-podzol, brown mountain-forest, sod-brownsoil and mountain-meadow soils, which formed respectively in the mountain forests and meadows) and Crimea (brown mountain-forest, sod-brownsoil and mountain-meadow, brown mountain soils).</p> 
<p class="rvps2"> soil formation - a complex potses that takes hundreds or thousands of years. Modern soils formed in Ukraine in the postglacial era.</p> 
<p class="rvps2"> most closely related to soil with natural vegetation cover. Soil fertility affect crop yield natural and cultural vegetation. Ukraine&#39;s soil undergo significant changes under the influence of economic activity: deteriorating soil structure, fertility decreases. Due to excessive irrigation and salinity is waterlogging of soils. Under the influence of herbicides dramatically reduced the number of microorganisms in the soil.</p>
