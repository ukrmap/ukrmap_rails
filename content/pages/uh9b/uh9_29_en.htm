<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most favorable conditions fordeployment of the Polish national liberation movement after the suppression of the PolishUprising 1863-1864 biennium in Russian Empire formed in the AustrianEmpire (from 1867 - Austro-Hungarian monarchy), where duePolish-Austrian compromise Galicia gained autonomy in which the leadingpositions occupied by Poles.
