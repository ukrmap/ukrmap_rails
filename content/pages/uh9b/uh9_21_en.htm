Rural reform of 1861freed the peasants from serfdom and eliminated this obstacle to the formationfree-market labor.

During the second half of the centuryDnieper, like other regions of Europe, experienced a population explosion -explosive growth of population. As a result, its population grew lessthan 40 years at 72%. Inability to function in the village forced villagers to seekwork. During the 60-70&#39;s number of workers of industrial enterprisesincreased from 86 thousand to 330 thousand after reforms became night time attractionimpoverished peasants to work in industry, growing cities, forming newindustrial centers.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, recovery of domesticTrade in Dnieper Ukraine enriched central Russian provincebecause it came from there most industrial goods. Ukrainianpopulation was forced to buy Russian industrial goods (mostlyMade from Ukrainian raw materials) at inflated prices. In this way, Ukrainianfinanced industrial development in the heart of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The share of traditionalUkrainian trade fairs in general decreased. For Tradeagricultural products and craftworks, as before, camewholesale distribution in the samples. As a result, fair trade has becomenature of stock transactions.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To meet the daily needsurban population in cities and towns gathered bazaars, which soldfood. Increase their network of 60-90&#39;s was associatedindustrialization and growth of cities. In the late nineteenth century. Kyivworked daily six markets in Kharkiv and Odessa - five.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Merchants in post has grownnumerically and increased its influence in society. But due to limitations of previousUkrainian decades merchants remained in the minority, yielding quantitatively andthe influence of Russian merchants.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In postDnieper occupied an important place in foreign trade empire. ThroughAzov-Black Sea ports and located on the Russian-Austrian borderCustoms Volhynia and Podolia exported a large quantity of goods produced inUkraine. Most goods exported was raw. Along with the grainexported a considerable quantity of animal products - meat, fat, skin,wool, etc.. Through the port of Odessa in the 80-90&#39;s exported millionsUkrainian pounds of sugar and hundreds of thousands of buckets of alcohol. In most contemporaryEuropean countries it is consumed Ukrainian sugar.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, the development of foreignTrade brought no significant benefit of the Ukrainian people. For backward fromleading European countries in the Russian Empire export of Ukrainian raw materialswas one of the most important sources of revenues. At a time when the Ukrainian peasantssaw sugar, he ustanovlyuvav saharozavodchika Prize for his removal. InDnieper Ukraine inflated sugar prices (because profits went toimperial treasury), resulting in the London sugar sold three times cheaperthan at home. As finance minister, said the Empire of the content of its foreignTrade: &quot;insufficient, but take out!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Through ports and customsNaddniprianshchyna were imported while cotton, silk and wool fabrics, tea,coffee, spices, rice, wine, etc.. Customs duties on imported goods were stillsource of replenishment of the imperial treasury.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Agricultural Relations</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rural reform of 1861freed peasants from personal dependence, but little has improved their economicsituation. Most of the farmers received insufficient in size for normaldevelopment of economy of land. However, architects of reform have not considerednatural population growth, resulting in plots that are ownedpeasants were reduced to catastrophic proportions. In 1914 on thesame allotment of land as in 1861, in Dnieper Ukraineled economy nearly twice as many farmers. In addition, villagers besieged toohigh taxes and payments for the land. According to official figures, at the endNineteenth century. farmers paid 10 times more taxes than the nobles.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The emergence of rural poor has a directconsequence of reforms in 1861 Most farmers had little chance to buy noradditional land or agricultural equipment. Unable to conduct independentagriculture, farmers were forced to go to work on the lord&#39;s land. Sozberihlysya remnants of serfdom as vidrobitkovoyi system that waslanded estates by peasants tilling their implements.

Realizing her discomfort, some landownersabandon and replaced free-refining work. Usingfree-labor farms are dominated Right Bank and the South, andLeft were distributed both systems.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite the poverty of mostpeasantry Naddniprianshchyna, she kept the role of European breadbasket.Most prominent commodity grain production growth was in the South, the historicalfree-dominated job.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the same time with increasingcommodity grain production increased sugar, barley and tobacco.Commodity character acquired livestock.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. The resettlement of peasants in East</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Acute shortage of land inDnieper Ukraine forced farmers to seek other means of subsistence.Land has increased in value, in some regions to 1861 - three to fourtimes. Most of the farmers were unable to buy land or find jobs inagriculture. City with his new life vidlyakuvalo many peasants.Farmers usually kept community, and if traveled, he sought to settle on newold Ukrainian lands and villages to work on the ground. Meanwhile in Ukrainepereyizdyly Russian peasants who went to work in factories. SoRussian migration to cities was directed Dnieper Ukrainian - tovillages in the eastern empire. According to economists, the surplus laborforces in Dnieper Ukraine reached 68% of the working population.</span></p>
