<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The development of human societydepends among other factors, the characteristics of geography andnatural conditions, in which it existed. Ukrainian lands are located insouth-eastern Europe.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Almost no two-thirds ofUkrainian lands were vast black soil, which had been the mainrich people, and simultaneous - the cause of constant attacks on neighborsthem.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Life in this region affected thethe distinctive features of social life Ukrainian. Fertile soils allowedUkrainian peasants successfully conduct individual farm as opposed to theirnorthern neighbors - the Russians, where poor soil and harsh climate forcedfarmers join forces to work together. These features ledformation of different mentality and socio-economic organization of nations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The majority of Ukrainianpeople at the end of XVIII century. were peasants who worked long rangeland, living in the picturesque villages and have been slow to spell them on urban housing.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Changes in Ukrainian life in the imperialpower</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the end of XVIII century. landUkrainian populated, found themselves in the Austrian and Russian imperialpolitical systems, the life which significantly differed from the usual conditions. BothEmpire were huge territorial associations, consisting of centerand dependent territories inhabited by different peoples.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Empire had a centralizedmanagement structure with a person of the emperor at the top of the pyramid of power.Compliance with laws and regulations of the imperial government relied on numerousofficialdom. Among the various tasks entrusted to the imperialbureaucracy, was the most important collection of taxes. But they usednot to local needs and plans for implementation of the empire and of course the needs ofofficials themselves. All means of influence empire reared their humility andloyalty, stressing that this is the main moral and religious dutycitizens. Therefore, most people gradually prystosovuvalasya to imperial ordersand considered them quite clever.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Great value in managingtribes who served areas along with bureaucrats licked army. For localmilitary population became familiar figure, and for social elite militaryservice was an opportunity to make a good career. At the same time keepingImperial Army became a heavy burden for the population of Ukrainian lands.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Feature of life within the empireit was more regulation. Ukrainian society previous daypublic authorities - as the Cossack officers and Polish nobility -never admired publishing a large number of documents relating to the orderingof everyday life. Imperial power, in contrast, found it necessaryregulate the lives of its multi-nationals on the ground, according tocommon standards, numerous orders from the capital.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The attitude of both empires toUkrainian lands zaharblenyh them at the end of XVIII century., few significant differences.The Austrian Empire was a group of different nations from among whom none hadabsolute majority. Consequently, the Austrian government has never triedassert that the Ukrainian lands are indigenous imperial lands, and onlyasserted its right to possess them, while recognizing that they inhabit othernations. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Russian empire neverrecognized that conquered the land, inhabited by other people, on the contrary, the Russian governmentconsistently emphasized that the earth is Naddniprianshchyna ancient and integral partRussia, which was previously selected her, and now returned. Ukrainian peoplethought was &quot;Little Russians&quot; and part of &quot;Great Russian people.&quot; Only in the lateNineteenth century. due to the deployment of Ukrainian nationalism in the imperialtop of them increasingly with almost unconcealed irritation began to speakas &quot;inorodtsiv. The presence in the empire of the Russian people, which wasmajority of the population, causing violent Russification policies in all spheressocial life. Consequently, the issue of preserving national culture,history and language is, literally, a matter of survival as the Ukrainian nation.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Mentality of the Ukrainian people</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To understand life in the Ukrainianimperial power is important to understand how they perceived reality thatfelt and what cared, or determine their characteristics <b style="">mentality.</b> For him, were such features:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">locationUkraine on the brink of the impact caused the two worlds of two major types of reactionsUkrainian to surrounding realities. The threat of enslavement and loss of homelandfirmest impelled to devote his life to defend the homeland. It is for themformed the famous Ukrainian Cossacks. Another type of the Ukrainian peoplewere those who tried to adjust to life in constant danger.Central to these was to survive, escape from enemies, hide their feelings andlearn to live under the rule of the invaders. It begins from here eternalUkrainian attempts to adapt to the current authorities on the principle of &quot;nothinghear of it, could be worse. &quot; It formed the &quot;Little Russian mentality&quot;(&quot;Little Russian syndrome&quot;) and &quot;rutenstvo. Number of people first, Cossack,type, inclined to fight for their rights, has always been lower since a largeof them dying in defense of their homeland;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">featurenational character of the Ukrainian people was his neahresyvnist. Forages they never tried to grab land neighbors, just wanted to haveopportunity to live peacefully on their own land. </span></p>

<p class="spis1" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sinceas the Russian Empire abolished the autonomy Hetmanate for representativesformer Cossack because equalizing the rights of Russiannobility was a possibility for a brilliant career. A typical examplemanifestation of the &quot;Little Russian mentality&quot; in these statements was a descendant ofgeneral judge Basil Kochubey - Victor Kochubey, who became one of theFriends of Russian Emperor Alexander I. &quot;Although I was born khokhols -he said - I more Russian than anyone else ... My situation brings meabove all petty considerations. I see your concern provinces(Dnieper Ukraine) from the perspective of the common interests of all oursociety. Little Russian views I have not bypassed. &quot;Little Russian&quot; wasdisease not only of the Ukrainian people, similar phenomena were observed in allpeoples subjugated empires. Still, it should be noted that those who startedprocess of the Ukrainian national revival of the Left, also came out withLittle ranks of nobility.</span></p>

Cultivatedas apples, pears, cherries, plums, and in the South - cherries, nuts,Apricots, peaches, and the Black Sea in Transcarpathia - grapes. Ukrainianfarmers have long been able to inculcate a tree and brought a lot of varieties with hightaste. Only in Podolsk province, according to contemporaries, inNineteenth century. existed about a hundred varieties of apples, among which were those whereeach weighed about 600 apple d. Several varieties of fruit trees were removed from the evenUkraine to the Americas.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">7. Religious fighting on the Right Bank</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Because division of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealthby the Russian Empire were the earth, most of them within twocenturies lived in fundamentally different terms. During the Polish rule in these landsalong with Catholics and Orthodox existed a large number of thoseprofessed Greek Catholic faith. At their associated lands were about1.5 million people. During the first half of the nineteenth century. occurred on the Right Bank&quot;Struggle for the soul&quot; Greek Catholics (or, as they were then called, Uniate) betweenPolish Catholics and Russian Orthodox Church. Involvement to the Uniatehis faith was for both sides is very important because it was about politicalFuture Right Bank. Poles considered as part of the Right Bank of PolandState, which is struggling to restore, while the Russian government believed thata purely Russian lands, which the Poles have long tried opolyachyty.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Relying on force, the Russiangovernment immediately after accession launched a campaign to restore the leading roleOn the Right Bank of the Orthodox Church. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For most believers Ukrainianconversion to Orthodoxy was not so much change the church, but actually returningto the original faith - for a substantial part of the Right Bank union existedonly a few decades and imposed by force.

This explained the needorder of the king&#39;s government, under which all builtOrthodox churches were to be returned to them. Four Greek Catholic Diocese(Kiev, Kamjanetsky, Vladimir, Lutsk) was eliminated as of 5thousand parishes left only 200. Many representatives of the Greek Catholicclergy were sent into exile, and church property and land confiscated.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another situation has developed in thoseregions where the Greek Catholic Church for two hundred years had vkorenytysyaspiritually and culturally, the population was perceived as the belief of parents. Here, evenpressure of Russian administration in transition orthodoxy scale and pace of imaginationnot impressed. One reason was the fact that the Catholic Polish nobility,which remained at the local level, the most influential force, inducedGreek Catholics go into Catholicism. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This forced the imperial power switchwith flexible tactics. Emperor Paul I (1796-1801) took a feworders, which provided more or less normal conditions for the Catholics and the Byzantine Rite.
