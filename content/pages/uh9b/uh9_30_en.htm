<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First time political significancestarorusynska flow came in 1866 when Austria lost the war againstPrussia. Then the rumor went, that sooner or later suffer the fate of Austria SpeechesCommonwealth, and Galicia go to Russia. Old Ruthenians clearly expressedposition, stating that a separate Ukrainian nation exists, and the Galician Rutheniansrepresent &quot;a unique velykorusskoho people&quot; who resides in&quot;From the Carpathians to the Urals. They also objected to the independence of the Ukrainian language;it, without any grounds for it, proclaimed one single pronunciationRussian language.</span></p>

An important focus of their work was the struggle against drunkenness.Old Ruthenians started publishing a series of popular books for farmers artificiallycreated a language called &quot;yazychiyem. It was a horrible mishmash of Russian,Ukrainian, Polish, and Church Slavonic languages. Gradually, this mixturepassed and periodicals was published ethnographic and scientific contributionsworks by Russian and local writers.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Such pro-Russian position could notnot seen in St. Petersburg. The tsarist government in support of Old Rutheniansdirected substantial subsidy.

Butstarorusynstvo phenomenon was wider and had a solid resistance in Galician society.The main feature was a clear anti-Polish starorusynstva orientation, resistanceany penetration of modern Western influences. Having doubts about the capacityindependently defend their culture, and the more political existence, theystated: &quot;If we are to go down, you better do it in a Russian seathan in a Polish bog.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the populist movement candistinguish two stages.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first (1860 -1879) - registration ideological movement, active cultural and educationalactivities of its representatives to the awakening of national consciousnesspopulation.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Second (1879 -1890)-active political engagement, organizational designmovement.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Populists preaching ideasnational revival, initiated by Ruska three &quot;and figures fromDnieper Ukraine. They came out of that Ukrainian - separatenation, residing in the territory from the Caucasus to the Carpathians. The main objectivesof populists were development of Ukrainian language on the basis of nationaldialects, a unified literary language, raising the cultural levelpeople of Western lands, unite the national intelligence forces.That is why the first phase of its activities are focused on cultural and educationalaspect.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first the differences betweenOld Ruthenians and populists concerned only language and literature. In otheraspects of the supporters of both areas have much in common and looked at the controversyas manifestations of differences between older and younger members of one family.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The activity began narodovtsiattempt at establishing the periodicals and the creation of communities, such as Kiev,seniors and students from the city (the first community established in1863 D. Tynyachkevych). Communities played a huge role in educatingGalician youth in the spirit of national consciousness and gave a significant number of workersUkrainian national liberation movement.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1862-1863 he populistsorganized around the literary weekly &quot;Vechornytsi&quot; (F. Zarevych,D. Tynyachkevych, V.

ThroughWeekly lack of funds declined, but vidtvoryvsya called &quot;objective&quot;(1863-1864 biennium), edited by young writer Xenophon Klymkowych.Then edited by Kostya Horbal out magazine &quot;Niva&quot;, and Vladimir Shashkevych -&quot;Mermaid&quot;.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In an environment where allcultural and educational institutions in Galicia were influenced by Old Ruthenians, populistsresorted to creating its own network of cultural and educational institutions. In1861 they founded the &quot;Rus conversation, and later her theater, which wasfirst professional Ukrainian theater. His first performance he gave in1864</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Breakthrough was the creation1868 society &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, which had by statute: &quot;spomahaty folkGap areas of moral, material and political. In the proclamation ofestablishment of &quot;Enlightenment&quot; stated that it his business to &quot;zalozhytyfuture of our peoples. &quot;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Milestone in the activities of the populistswas the establishment in 1873 Lviv by Shevchenko Society, which subsequently,without their own state, effectively played the role of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.</span></p>

Ukrainian leaders have tried from Dnieperturn in Galicia &quot;Ukrainian Piedmont, providing both financial andintellectual assistance to the national movement in Galicia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From 1879, after defeatOld Ruthenians in elections to the Galician Diet, populists have acted aspolitical force.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first political act populistswas the publication of that same year, the newspaper for peasants &quot;Fatherland&quot;, edited by JulianRomanchuk, which proves their desire to lure a wide audience of peopleGalicia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In December 1879 the counselmeeting with 36 people under the leadership decided to launch RomanchukUkrainian daily newspaper &quot;Delo&quot; that, in contrast starorusynskomu &quot;Word&quot;&quot;Deeds, not words make for better people.&quot; The editor wasV. Barvinsky. The first issue was released in January 1880</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the same year to discusssituation and needs of Ukrainian society V. Barvinsky called in Ukrainefirst Ukrainian mass meeting (assembly), which converges to some 2 million people.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Growth in popularity populistscontributed Muscophiles trial. Found themselves on the dock AdolfDobriansky and his daughter Olga Grabar., I. Naumovich, VI and other PloschanskyyMuscophiles. Although the accused was acquitted, the investigation revealed unsightlyaspects in the Muscophiles, particularly their relations with the Russian tsarism.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1882 was loudprocess Olga Grabar, daughter of Adolf Dobriansky, leader of Transcarpathian Old Rutheniandirectly. She was accused of anti-state activities, as itretained links with antyavstriysky minded Russian politiciansforces. Found themselves on the dock Adolf Dobriansky, I. Naumovich,V. Ploschanskyy and other Muscophiles. Olga Grabar court justified because of its tieswere exclusively cultural. Later she went to Russia together with his father (herson - the famous painter, academician Igor Grabar).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This trial had otherconsequences. In 1882 Old Ruthenians between populists and the transaction was concluded inwhich is determined by an agreed framework for the future. Since then, for doingcases, &quot;common to all Rusyns&quot; had formed committees with equal number of representativesboth flows. Over time, the arrangements became more umovnishymy becausefurther qualitative development of parties was not the same. Narodovstvo activelydeveloped, while starorusynstvo, played its historical role indeterrence process polonized, exhausted himself and become an anachronism.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Political activitypopulists led to their establishment in 1885 his political organization -People&#39;s Council, which was led by J. Romanchuk. Her first general meeting heldFebruary 2, 1888</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Conquest leading populistsposition in the Ukrainian movement forced them to pave the path to the Ukrainianpeasantry - the main source of strength of the Ukrainian movement, these trails could notavoid rural Greek Catholic priests. Compromise of the clergy andagreement stipulated the entry of the Old Ruthenians narodovstvom conservative figure.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Socio-political movements inUkrainian movement - and starorusynstvo narodovstvo - phenomena were purelyUkrainian origin, arising as a reaction to the Ukrainian societychallenges. Still, even the most active activities populists and Old Ruthenianscould not provide the exaltation of the Ukrainian society to the level of other Europeannations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Leaders of the Ukrainian movement inGalicia realized that no serious public support any politicalstruggle will not be successful.
