<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1816, with the supportBishop John Mohylnytskyy created the &quot;Society of Galician Greek Catholicpriests to spread education and writing culture among the faithful. &quot; This groupsought to publish books for people, understood by him in Ruthenian,and establish national schools. </span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Activities Peremyshl Patriotscaused discontent among the Poles who fought before in eastern Galicia. Theydemanded from the Austrian authorities to ban the teaching in primary schoolsRuthenian language, because they claimed that only the Russian language version.But imperial officials have been slow to meet these requirements becauseunderstood that this would strengthen the Polish influence in the region. Therefore the decisionlittle compromise. Greek Catholics, the Roman Catholics had the rightteach children their own language. In mixed schools taught both languages, butreligious classes were held separately, according to the religion of children. Bothchurch separately acquired the right to oversee their schools.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Activity of the Company ... &quot;gradually assuming proportions. To train teachers in Przemysl wasdyako open-Teacher Training Institute (1817).

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">John and his Mohylnytskyysupporters defended the view that russka language is distinct from the Polish andRussian Slavonic. However, they felt it necessary to do folkrefined language, combining it with the old Church Slavonic. Mohylnytskyycreated the grammar of this &quot;SLA</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">vyenoruskoyi &quot;language, but it had real character and distribution has not acquired.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Parts of the first stage of Ukrainiansense formation of nation at Western</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the first,folklore-ethnographic phase of the national movement, as you already know, thanksknowledge of the history, language and folk culture laid the foundations of nationalidentity of the people.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Historical research sat inthis process the crucial place. The possibility of relying on past achievementsadding &quot;adherents&quot; of forces in the race for the future of his people. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The history of Galicia and its indigenouspopulation examined <b style="">Denis Zubritsky</b>(1777-1862). Among his major works were &quot;Description of the history of the people of Rus&quot; and&quot;The History of Galician-Ruthenian principality&quot; in three volumes. In these and other workscontrary to the assertion of Polish historians researcher proved convincingly that it isRusyns are the native population of Eastern Galicia, part of the Ukrainian people,most of which lives on the east. Prominent role in the study of historyTranscarpathia played historian <b style="">MichaelPop Luchkaya</b> (1789-1843). The main scientific work was the six-volume &quot;HistoryCarpatho-Rusyns. In it he proved the autochthonous (local origination)nature of the Ruthenian population of Transcarpathia who inhabited this land long beforearrival of Hungarians. For language and culture of Carpatho-Rusyns are identical with their Ukrainian brothersthe Carpathians.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first attempt to create a grammarRuthenian language made at the end of XVIII century. Transcarpathianscientist and linguist, a representative of the Greek Catholic clergy Arseniy Kotsak.But give her he could not.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First at Western&quot;Grammar theology</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">no-Ruthenian &quot;was issued in 1830Its author was M.Pop-Luchkaya. Contemporaries praised the work of the scientist. MembersGalician group &quot;Ruska Trinity Holovatsky, M. and I. Shashkevych Vahylevychdeeply respected by his grammar and considered the best work among allcreated at Western.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Influence of European IdeasRomanticism led to the increasing interest of Western statesfolk culture. The first expressed interest Rusyn folkPolish ethnographers. During his travels lands of Poland, Galicia, Belarusand researcher Naddniprianshchyna Zorian Dolenha-Khodakovskiy collected over 2 thousand peoplesongs. Without the ability to publish the materials he sold themMr. Zaleski and Maksymovych. In 1833 Pole Vaclav Detroit gave muchcollection of &quot;Polish and Ruthenian songs Galician people. With the emergence of this workinterested readers initially could potsinuvaty unique beauty of Rusynfolk songs. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Example B. Zaleski led towork of other collectors of folklore. In 1835 Western Collectionwedding songs &quot;Ruske Wedding issued Greek-Catholic priest Joseph Lozinski.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Folk songs Galician Rusynsadded to its collection of &quot;Little Russian Songs&quot; M. Maximovich. This factdemonstrated understanding of the Ukrainian intelligentsia and artistic affinity for organicLyrics unity of the Ukrainian people throughout the his residence. </span></p>
