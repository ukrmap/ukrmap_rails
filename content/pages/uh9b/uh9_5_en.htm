After winningRussian government was giving away these lands, and along with them on those livingCossacks, Russian dignitaries and foreign colonists. The prospect of rotation toserfs prompted the Cossacks from the Russian government to seek permission torelocation to other places.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Empress Catherine <span class="SpellE">ІІ</span> decided to approve the request of the Cossacks. From this ithad a double benefit: pozbuvalasya Cossacks from Ukraine and due to their resettlementon the mainland to ensure the protection of borders of the empire.

They likviduvalasyamilitary council, private property zatverdzhuvalasya officers on the ground that their earlierwas appointed over the army. Finally, it was abolished long-standing ban Cossackconcerning women. <span class="SpellE">Katerynodar</span> Sich was not as usualcity where the family lived Cossacks. </span></p>

Married Cossacks lived separately, outside of the basket; Cossack chieftain, byancient tradition, every year pereobyraly Cossack general council. Eachhut had his badge or flag. Besides Cossack chieftain, was elected secretary,captain, smoking atamans. By order of the Sultan has always been to Host Turkishofficer, whose official duty was to issue passports to those who left herlimits, and unofficial - to observe the behavior of the Cossacks.</span></p>
