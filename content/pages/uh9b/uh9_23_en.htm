<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. The Polish uprising of 1863-1864 biennium andUkraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1863-1864 he Right BankUkraine was one of the areas where the unfolding events of the Polish national EID</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Volny uprising. For a long time itprepared by the Central National Committee, which had close ties with the Polishemigration in Western Europe. The main purpose of the rebellion proclaimed competitionPoland&#39;s national independence and reform. But on the borders of the restoredPolish state and the depth of the views of social reform rebelliondiverged. Much of the leaders of the uprising, supported the restorationPoland&#39;s borders in 1772, ie the division of the Commonwealth.The uncertainty in the end, had negative consequences: the Ukrainian peasants and workersUkrainian movement did not support the rebellion.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In preparation for the uprising, its leaderspaid great attention to the Right Bank Ukraine. Here lived a significant partPolish population (485 thousand, or 9.2%), these lands once belonged to thePolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and another uprising in Ukraine had to distract the forces of the king&#39;s troopsof the Polish uprising of their own lands. In Right-Bank Ukraine uprisingprepared the &quot;Central Committee in Russia&quot;, then &quot;Provincial Committee in Russia.The leaders of the uprising were designed: in Kiev province -V. Rudnitsky, Podolski - Yablonovsky, Volyn - E. Ruzhitsky.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Uprising that began the nightJanuary 23, 1863, quickly spilled over in Lithuania, Belarus and of the rightUkraine.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Right-Bank Ukraine actedsome 20 guerrilla groups, which consisted mainly of representativesPolish gentry. All attempts to bring the rebels to their side of the Ukrainian peasantswere unsuccessful. Farmers sometimes even helped Russian troops againstPoles. Of the nearly 20 thousand rebels were only 500 Russians and BelarusiansUkrainian. From the Ukrainian who took part in the revolt can be calledA. Slavic languages (military organization led by &quot;Earth and will&quot;), I. Nechaya (guerrilla commanderunit, which operated in the area of Lublin) and others.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite heroic resistance, the uprising in1864 was suppressed.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">7. Valuev Circular and its implications</span></h3>
