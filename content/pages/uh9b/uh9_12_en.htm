<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The highest representative body inProvince was the Diet, the leading position in which the occupied Polish nobility. ButDiet powers were limited, and its activity is controlled by the imperialadministration. Since 1861 created two separate boundary Diet - inGalicia and Bukovina, which operated before the First World War.</span></p>
