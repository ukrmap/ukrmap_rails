<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the second half of the centuryWestern Ukraine population increased. AccordingAustrian and Hungarian state censuses of 1857 and 1900, theWestern Ukraine was just under 2600 and 3814 thousand thousand Ukrainian.As for this segment the total population has increased significantly,Ukrainian share in its stock dropped.

They remained an agrarian society, since 95%trudylosya population on earth, and about 1% worked in industrialenterprises. Western intellectuals, including the local clergy,was numerically small. Thus, in eastern Galicia, it was about 0,5%of the total Ukrainian population. At the same time the Poles, for example,accounted for 22% of the inhabitants of eastern Galicia, and their intelligence was over 3%total population.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Features of Economic DevelopmentGalicia, Bukovina and Transcarpathia</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Revolutionary events1848-1849 biennium were an important stage in the development of European countries. Despitethat the revolution ended in defeat, they made it possible to speed up the processfurther development of industrial society. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A completely different situation toWestern lands. After 1848 feudal order is notimpede economic growth. However, the western land tolast days of the empire remained the most backward in the economicplane of the territories of Austria-Hungary with the lowest standard of living.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, thankspolicy for the Vienna and western and central provinces of Austria-Hungaryrapidly developing industry, and Galicia, Bukovina and Transcarpathiapreserved ancient, agrarian nature of the economy. Its development in Westlands increasingly defined interests in large-scale industrywestern provinces.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The imperial government actually did not useany measures for industrial development at Western. Governmentrange of West Ukrainian businessmen refused to give tax reliefthose used in the western provinces. Access West Ukrainian goods onmarkets of Austria-Hungary and neighboring countries was actually closed. Simultaneouslythere were incentives for the export of raw materials and semi-finished here. Eveninside edge of West Ukrainian entrepreneurs was very hard to keep competitiveagainst foreign firms. Cheap factory goods are squeezed from the market placeproducts.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">AgricultureWestern Ukraine has developed very slowly. Huge landtracts were owned by landlords, while most peasants constantlysuffered from the shortage of arable land. The natural population growth moreaggravated the situation. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Economic situationWestern lands in Austria-Hungary still remainedclose to the Colonial.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. The development of industry</span></h3>

The vast majority of industrial workers are not workingin large-scale industries and to small enterprises and workshops. Byofficial figures, 1885 in Eastern Galicia in 175 companiesmanufacturing industry with the number of workers over 20 were only 10 thousandshower. In Transcarpathia, but then there were several such businesses, and all of Bukovinawas not.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Branch structure of industryland was one-sided. The bulk of the product gave the field of mining andprocessing of local raw materials - forest, wood, oil, brown coal,salt. The biggest industry was the oil industry, which began to develop withmid-nineteenth century. Center for the oil industry was Borislav. Controldevelopment of this industry immediately set Austrian and German businessmen.The interest in increasing exports of oil Galician encourage them toapplication of technical improvements. The result was growthOil production from 20 tons a year in 1874 to 326 thousand tons in1900 But the Viennese government prevented construction naftoperehinnyhplants in eastern Galicia.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If the sawmill industrydeveloped rapidly, the pace of furniture manufacturing and other industriestimber industry was very slow. Requirements of the Westernpopulation in furniture, paper and cardboard satisfied imported products.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the least developed areasowned light industry and metal processing industry.

InEastern Galicia there were also several match factories, steel andbuilding enterprises.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The development industry has been associatedwith the emergence of new social groups - industrial workers.In the late nineteenth century. their number in the land was about 55 thousand souls.The sources of replenishment of the working class were ruined artisans and peasants.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">State of Westworkers was among the worst in Europe. In pursuit of high profitsentrepreneurs are reluctant to spend money to create safe working conditions.Consequently, the constantly increasing number of accidents. Inmining Transcarpathia their number was several timeshigher than in the central provinces of the Empire and other Western European countries.</span></p>

Sometimes sizefee income reached several days. Size paid industrial workersdid not provide them a living wage.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Severe working conditions and lowliving standards among workers were causing the spread of diseases such astuberculosis, rheumatism, etc.. Medical care because of its high costwas almost inaccessible to them.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Changes in agriculture</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Agricultural reforms implemented inWestern Ukraine during the revolution of 1848-1849 biennium, the peasants uvilnylyremnants of serfdom, but their situation remains very serious. During hisfreeing peasants had for 50 years to pay annual fees. Ingeneral reform of 1848 Western peasantry cost over 300million florins.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In favor of the landowners to resolveand the land question. Although under the reform for the peasants had to be keptthose lands, which they enjoyed, they stripped the landlords more fertile grounds.West-land became the land, where agriculture majorpicture were small sized farms 2.5 hectares and large landpossession of 15-20 hectares.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consequently, the Evolutionagriculture took place very slowly. In economic relationspeasants and landlords dominated the refining - with borrowed grain as rentearth, wood and more. Only in the late nineteenth century. refining steel yieldfree &quot;work place. About 80% of farms were putless than 5 hectares(Remember that portion size could provide the minimum needs of the farmer).Consequently, most farms were doomed to poverty,ruin and decay.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the main issues forfarmer at the time was right to use the servitude. Landownerspreviously administered excessive price for their use, knowing that ultimately leadfarmers anywhere. Hopes of thousands of peasants to find justice in the courts wereuseless.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">New problem in napivzhebratskomulife of the Western peasantry was usury. Forced to borrow moneyto pay many taxes, farmers quickly found themselves depending onmoneylenders, who, resorting to shameless fraud, under the pretext of a debt andinterest on it (on average 150-250%) taken away their business.The result was impenetrable plight of the peasants spread drunkenness.
