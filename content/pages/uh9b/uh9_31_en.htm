<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Radical movements in the Ukrainian movementGalicia</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Out of the Ukrainian movement (asOld Ruthenians and populists) in the broad political arena was inevitableThe result influence of modern European political theory, particularlysocialism. New developments in eastern Galicia initiated intelligentsiaat that time was more developed in the intellectual plane. This was caused,particularly vigorous activity Drahomanov Michael, who urged young peopleexpand their intellectual horizons, to get acquainted with the best achievements of Europeanand Russian culture, science, go on the older generation, not only words butraise deed Ukrainian society. Responded to his call a smallWestern group of young people. So the Ukrainian movement took anothertrend - radically.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first proponents Drahomanovappeared in the Vienna of Ukrainian Students Club Sich. End70&#39;s Nineteenth century. it supported the idea of two students of Lvivgroups: one that was influenced by Old Ruthenians - &quot;Akademycheskyy circle,another - populist &quot;friendly uncle&quot;. Then circle supportersextended. The most capable followers became John opinions DrahomanovFranco and Michael Pavlik, who raised the Ukrainian movement in Galicia on the newintellectual level, overcome its limitations and provincial conservatism.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Michael I. Pavlik </span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">(1853-1915) -social, cultural and educational activist, writer. He came from a peasant familyfrom Stanislav. After graduating from high school in Lvov 1874 enteredLviv National University. There he became a member of &quot;Akademycheskoho mug andcollaborated in its printed media of &quot;Friend&quot;, where he met Ivan Franko.Ideas Drahomanov made a great impression on him, and he became an ardent supporter of them.Together with Frank published the magazine &quot;Public Friend&quot;, almanacs &quot;Bell&quot; and&quot;Hammer&quot;. For his socialist views suffered persecution. Five timesgetting to the prison. In the end, was forced to emigrate to Switzerland, where hewith Podolynsky Drahomanov and published the magazine &quot;Community&quot;. He was one of the foundersRuthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party and editor of its print&quot;Khliborob&quot; and &quot;People&quot; (1890-1895 biennium). In 1895-1905 - the first librarianScientific Society. Shevchenko (Shevchenko Scientific Society). In 1914 became deputy chairmanMain Ukrainian Rada. Pavlik&#39;s creative heritage consists of artworks, translations and publications.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The activity of representatives of the newflow began with an active outreach. Since 1876 Pavlik andFranco edited the magazine &quot;friend.&quot; They rejected &quot;yazychiye&quot;, which publishedmagazine, and went on Ukrainian folk dialect. My first critical articlethey are directed against the Old Ruthenians, causing them yet another serious blow.Then they touched and populists, ridiculing them for literary peresichnistproducts and conservatism. But the brunt of criticism was directed againstclergy that his radical youth tried to eliminate fromleadership role in the spiritual life of society. This sharp criticism mixedperceived as the leaders of the Ukrainian movement, and the Western Ukrainian society in general.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Exodus in the new political trend inbroad political arena contributed lawsuit 1877-1878 biennium against Franco andhis comrades. Socialist ideas, which advocated a new flow figures wereThe result in charges of subversion.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although the general idea thatproclaimed radicals were not accepted by the Ukrainian society, theyled to the emergence of new supporters of socialist ideas (Nicholas perpetual,Stanislav Kozlovsky, Cyril Trylovskyy, Vyacheslav Budzynovskyy, VladimirOhrimovych etc.)..</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Radicals created in October1890 the first Ukrainian political party in Galicia -Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party (RURP). In sharp internal debate betweenold and young radicals for the first time the Ukrainian movement was launched andreasonably postulate the unity of Ukrainian lands and political autonomyUkraine.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. &quot;New Era&quot; in Ukraine-Polandrelationship and its consequences</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Beginning Ukrainian politicizationmovement and crystallization of the idea of political independence of Ukraine were held under conditionsWhen the Ukrainian question in Galicia was a political factor in primaryvalue. It turned out in three areas:</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">nationwide.Aspiration Austro-Hungarian ruling circles to use the Ukrainian question in the confrontationwith Russia, to avoid the radicalization of the Ukrainian movement, turning it intodestructive force;</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ukrainian.Implementation of ideas in the transformation of Galicia &quot;Ukrainian Piedmont.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">International situation has contributedUkrainian production problems at European level. Balkan crisisaggravated relations Austria-Hungary and Germany and Russia. Ukraine beganconsidered as a possible thorn war. In September 1886 Galicia visitedCaesar, in summer 1887 - the successor of the throne, Rudolf, who said thatUkrainian is the &quot;ancient cultural nation.&quot; Considerable publicity was inspired by GermanA. Chancellor Bismarck article &quot;Russia in Europe, where the idea expressedrestoration of the Kingdom of Kiev under the protection of the Habsburgs.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The idea of formation of the KievKingdom resonance caused by the Austrian, German, Russian,Ukrainian and Polish communities. Austro-Hungarian government is seriously interestedUkrainian movement in Dnieper Ukraine, hoping to use it toto separate Ukraine from Russia. This idea coincided with the aspirations of some leadersKyiv community (A., Rodin and others.) Incline to the side of Ukrainiancase by the decision of Austro-Hungarian monarchy in order to obtain newnational and cultural rights for the Ukrainian Galician. For this purpose it wasreconcile the Ukrainian and Polish in Galicia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Negotiations to reach aunderstanding began in the mid 80&#39;s They were conducted secretly in a narrowcircle of people. The Polish side presented Prince Adam Sapieha. He was of theone of the most influential at that time in the land of family, his father Leon was1861-1875 biennium Galician Sejm Marshal. Ukrainian - O. Barvinsky,A. Vahnyanyn, K. Telishevskyy et al. Who decided to keep the policy in Galicianconsultation with the Kiev community. Summer 1888 agreement was reached onmonthly publication &quot;The Truth&quot;, which would become the body of &quot;the whole of Ukraine-Rus&quot;promote &quot;spiritual unity&quot; of the Ukrainian people, redistributed between the twostates, and simultaneously prepare the society to the Polish-Ukrainian agreement. Itdefended the thesis that &quot;the future of the Ruthenian people connected with the interests of the stateAustrian and the fate of the Polish people. &quot; Further convergence failedtension over the election of 1889 to the Galician Diet.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Eventually, under pressure from Vienna andKiev parties to the agreement was reached and November 25, 1890 public.Official text of the agreement were not: she stuck to her promise initiators.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ukrainian demanded that the Polishland administration to recognize the independence of the Ukrainian nation and more to take care ofits development, with equal commitment to treat two people in Galicia, promisingloyalty to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Habsburg dynasty. Agreementsupported by the Greek Catholic Metropolitan Sylvester Sembratovych and Galiciangovernor Count Casimir Baden. As asserted by both parties, agreement had to start&quot;New era&quot; in the Ukraine-Polish relations. And yet, this policy did not last long.The Polish side was unwilling to make concessions that would allow the Ukrainian movementask questions about the division of Galicia to the Ukrainian and Polish and seekautonomous rights. In early 1894 both sides gave up its continuation.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yet, despite the failure, &quot;NE&quot;had a profound effect. Slowly realized the program, portrayed hertriggers. It included: the opening of the department of history of Ukraine in LvivUniversity of the Company name. Shevchenko scientific status with the prospectits transformation into the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. In fact, the department has been openedUkrainian history (she called the Department of Eastern European history), ScientificCompany by Shevchenko with a constant state subsidies, but without academic status;chotyryklasni school founded with the Ukrainian language of teaching menseminaries in Ternopil and Stanislav and women in Ukraine, Ukrainian parallelKolomiysky classes at school, a teacher seminary in Sambor, separatedUkrainian high school from Przemysl in Poland and more. In 1893 Ukrainianphonetic spelling was given official status and put it inschool books. It was also established precise society &quot;Dniester&quot; (1892) forUkrainian population. One of the direct consequences of the &quot;new era&quot; wasvisit to Lviv in 1894 Kiev young historian, a student of Mr. AntonovichHrushevsky, headed by our new department at Lviv University.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another important consequencePolish-Ukrainian agreement was accelerated structuring Ukrainianpolitical life in Galicia. Started the clear separation of political currents. Moreto proclaim a &quot;new era&quot; old radicals - Franco, Pavlik, and Terleckiothers. convened in early October 1890 Meeting of radical intellectuals inLviv and proclaimed the creation RURP. The radicals skillfully used the &quot;new era&quot;for political self-affirmation on the basis of its critics, and its failure led them toleading position in the Ukrainian movement. In the mid 90&#39;s they wererise, but 1895 packaged for its program of political demandUkraine&#39;s independence. In the ranks of the populists split. Continued policyagreement with the Poles defended group hurtuvalas around O. Barvinskyi - theirnovokursnykamy called. Later they turned into a small Christian-socialparty. They are supported above the Greek Catholic clergy. Most of thepopulists, led by J. Romanchuk won distinctively anti-Polish stance. Theircalled independent. But the constant vacillation of the populists fighting for cooperationthe Poles blew their credibility. In its current leadership starorusynskiy skochuvavsyato Russophilism and lost positions.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That same &quot;new era&quot; led toschism in the Ukrainian movement, which reflected negatively on the results of electionsGalician Sejm in 1895 Attempts by the convene a congress of representatives of all currentsin March 1894 to develop further joint position no successsmall.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nevertheless, the split and had positiveconsequences: at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. have political parties with well-definednational, state programs (national independence of Ukraine,unification of all Ukrainian lands into one state) that prevailed inUkrainian movement. Starorusynstvo finally declined.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Formation of Political Parties</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The end of the nineteenth century. wascrucial in the development of Ukrainian national movement. From the appearance of the firstUkrainian national idea vyhopylasya parties outside the intelligentsiaEnvironment and penetrated in masses. On the historical scene came newgeneration of energetic leaders, which demanded full independence of Ukraine.It was the late nineteenth century., Especially after the celebration of 100 years anniversary&quot;Aeneid&quot; Kotlyarevskogo began distributing the terms &quot;Ukraine,&quot; Ukrainian &quot;instead of &quot;Rus&quot;, &quot;Rus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As mentioned, the firstpolitical party was established in October 1890 LvivRuthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party (RURP), headed by I. Frank and M. Pavlik. In1895. the program was one added provision that most fully the idea of socialism canrealized within the independent Ukrainian state, but in the shortperspective - an autonomous province within the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.In addition to these provisions, the program put forward by farmers as the transfer requirementsmore land.

To promote program provisions werereleased a series of pamphlets under the title &quot;Radical tactics&quot; (Franko).Much attention has provided Party propaganda of the ideas in the peasant masses throughvarious institutions and organizations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite the hard work, throughradicalism, anticlericalism and socialist ideology RURP not received widesupport in Galician society, though in 90&#39;s took the leadingposition. Opposition to it has been configured clergy, which blocked access to the partyto the peasantry. Socialist ideas were not supported by paucityUkrainian proletariat.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After death he Drahomanovfreed from its ideological influences and moved on to positions samostiynytstva.Break with the Socialists was due to the fact that he realized: not socialismwill lead to national liberation of Ukraine, because under the socialist sloganspowerful nation can absorb others.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Development of Ukrainiannational liberation movement in Bukovina in the second half of the nineteenth century. -early twentieth century.</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Due to the lack of its own intellectualsUkrainian national revival in Bukovina started rather late.
