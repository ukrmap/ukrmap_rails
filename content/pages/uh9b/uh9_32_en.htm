<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Development of education in the 70-90&#39;sNineteenth century.</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the second half of the nineteenth century. Asand the first development of Ukrainian culture held in colonizationpolitical regimes that prevailed in Ukraine. The most popular are plaguededucation. Elementary and secondary schools was not enough. Until the abolition of serfdomin Russian Empire (1861) Education in Ukraine, especially primary,downfall. Nobles thought that farmers do not need education. Imperial Government almostusunuvsya completely from the material maintenance of primary schools.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In education, changes were feltalready on the brink of 60&#39;s Young intellectuals, students, grouped incommunity actively cared creating Sunday schools. In 1862 inUkraine were more than 110. Teaching in many of them has been prepared Ukrainianlanguage, was published primers and textbooks, including &quot;Primer&quot; Shevchenko.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The situation started to improveafter the reforms. In the 70&#39;s XIX century. zemstvo contributed to openingnew schools, care of the content and teaching methods. They increasedappropriation for maintenance and construction of schools. Since 1871 by 1895appropriations have increased in 6 times. Vprovadzhuvalosya study history, geography, mathematics.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On the Right Bank Ukraine, wherezemstva there was no system of primary education was subordinated to the RussianOrthodox Church. Ordinance 1881 stated &quot;that the influence of the clergy mustapply to all kinds of elementary schools. A 1884 Could Regulationsof church school.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The policy reforms carried outtsarism simultaneously with the policy of repression of Ukrainian culture. The Governmentallowed to study in Ukrainian. Valuev Circular and Ems decreeclearly defined the main direction of educational policy in the Russian TsarsUkraine: prevent the Ukrainian language at school. However, due to the spreadprimary education, literacy rates in the Ukrainian villages lateNineteenth century. was about 20%, and in cities - 50%.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Some changes in the field of education notomitted and Western Ukraine. In 1869 Government of the Austro-Hungarian Empire declaredgeneral compulsory school education at Western. But becausematerial privations many Ukrainian children were unable to attendschool. In addition, the vast majority of training was conducted: EasternGalicia - Polish, North Bukovina - German, Romanian,in Transcarpathia - Hungarian. It resulted that the level of literacy among Ukrainianpopulation barely reached 40%, and in mountainous areas - 10%.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Much more attention to the governments of Empirespaid to secondary education, because it was considered the foundation of higher education, whichprepared specialists of public administration, national economy, culture andScience.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the secondary education systemRussian Empire there were several types of schools: the classical school, real, Cadetand religious schools, seminaries. In some (classical schools) preferencestudy of Greek, Latin and logic, and their graduates were qualified toto enter universities in other (real) - modern Europeanlanguages, mathematics, natural sciences. In 1859 was opened in Kyivfirst women&#39;s gymnasium.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1876 school therein all provinces, and some county towns. In the 90&#39;s inUkraine was about 150 male and female gymnasiums.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For the separation of real andclassical secondary education in 1871 was a reform of secondaryeducation. Real gymnasium turned into a real school. They were clearlyexpressed by professional specialization, preparing students for practice.Training in High School lasted 6 years. Seventh, additional class gaveright to enter into technical universities. In 1876 were 19 real schools.Their number did not change until the end of the century.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Western Ukrainebasic secondary school was also a gymnasium, mainly from Polishlanguage. In 1899 Ukrainian school operated only in Lvov, Przemysl,and in Coloma, Ternopil and Chernivtsi - some high-school classes.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Special secondary educationdevelopment of industry has gained distribution. Industry, whichdeveloped, required a large number of specialists from various areas of management.In 1888, approved the &quot;Fundamentals of Industrial College,according to which created a system of industrial and technical education. Collegeprovide qualified personnel railway transport, mining,steel, sugar industry. They were preparing for professionalsagriculture, trade, fleet.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the vast Russian EmpireMost secondary schools, especially specialist wasassigned to several government agencies: the Ministry of NationalEducation - Teacher Seminary, interior -Veterinary College, the Army Department - Cadet Corps,military schools and school founded by the special synod theological institutions.Many secondary schools maintained zemstvo (vocational schools) orindividuals. Among the most famous was the last board Paul HalahanFounded in 1871 in Kiev. She worked in a special program andgive broad general knowledge of Ukrainian and humanities.</span></p>

In addition,Dnieper Ukraine encountered various cultural and educational associations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Contribution of the Scientific SocietyShevchenko in the formation of national science</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If the bank Ukrainescience developed as part of an all, we in the Westlands were laid the foundations of national Ukrainian science. Its centerwas Shevchenko Scientific Society (Shevchenko Scientific Society) - scientific and cultural publicorganization founded in 1892 Progressive Ukrainian public expenseLviv and other cities in Western Ukraine. The predecessor was NTShLiterature by Shevchenko Scientific Society, founded in December 1873Society was formed as the prototype of the Academy of Sciences - withhistorical and philosophical, philological, mathematical and natural-drugsection and subsection, from the edition of &quot;Records, books, magazines.Active members of the community and elected honorary members. Along withresearch activities conducted NTSh cultural and educational workpopulation. NTSh united experts in different fields of knowledge, writers,cultural and public figures from Western and Dnieper Ukraine, otherStates. Active members and leaders were NTSh O. Barvinsky, Hrushevsky,Franko, V. Hnatiuk, S. Tomashivskogo et al.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The main merit of the company wasthat in the absence of Ukrainian statehood, it servedUkrainian Academy of Sciences. Creative works NTSh (LNTSH) since 1873 on1939 amounted to 1172 volumes of various publications, including 943 volumes of serialscientific publications. In addition, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was the main publisher of Ukrainiantextbooks. Thanks NTSh were published in the first eight volumes of the monumental workHrushevsky &quot;History of Ukraine-Rus&quot;.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Major achievements were thesphere of social sciences: history (Labour Hrushevsky Dzhydzhora I., I. Krypyakevych,I. Krevetskoho, M. Korduby S. Tomashivskogo), philology and literature(Labour M. Wozniak, M.Derkach-Futrak, O. Ogonovsky, K. Studyns&#39;kogo, Franko)Ethnography, Folklore and Art (Publications V. Hnatiuk,Zubryc&#39;ka M., F.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">NTSh had undeniable merits indevelopment of the Ukrainian scientific terminology. Historical Society rolewas to withdraw Ukrainian Ukrainian science beyond. Tomost important achievements of members of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in exact and natural sciences shouldinclude the discovery of cathode rays of Life Ext (subsequently namedX-ray) Horbachevskyi synthesis of uric acid in the works of Zubryc&#39;kathe theory of mathematics, the contribution of S. and W.
