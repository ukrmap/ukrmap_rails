In the political field, students seeking a constitutional freedom ofpolitical autonomy, freedom of speech, press and assembly. The resolution alsoput forward the requirements of mandatory students of Ukrainian cultural andpolitical legacy, the spread of education among the people ofsocio-economic reforms.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A year later the Ukrainian studentsheld a second congress, which established a Central Union. GravamenUnion programs were:</span></p>
