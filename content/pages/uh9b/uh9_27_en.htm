<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By its nature, a local movementwas a liberal. At the core of a liberal alternative to the social development laythe idea of building an economic society based on free market and competition.The state had become law, protect democratic rights of the individual and the minimuminterfere in the economic sphere. The ideal form of government, liberals believedconstitutional monarchy. Not recognizing the forms and methods of revolutionary struggle inbasis of the activity they put the search for compromise with the ruling circles.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Zemsky movement wasall-but the Ukraine put it in front of such national andtasks as organizing primary education in Ukrainian.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Poreformenni first years (end60 - Top 70&#39;s) have been time for the movement of organizational development,awareness of the role and place among the social forces, and crystallization of the main goaltask. The main activities were directed at improvingsocio-economic status of peasants, raising its educational level.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the second stage of(Late 70&#39;s - early 1980</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">&#8209;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">х</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">years) zemstvo became centers of liberal opposition.Schorl active process zemstva synergies to achieve aConstitutional reforms in the Russian Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After killing the kingAlexander II, in terms of policy kontrreformAlexander III zemstva opposition activity began to decline, and withthe law of June 12, 1890 restrictions on representationnedvoryanskyh states in zemstvo it almost ceased. However at the beginningTwentieth century. they again become one of the centers of opposition to autocracy.</span></p>

A highly active zemstvo deployed in Chernihiv,Kharkiv, Poltava provinces. They are united by various forces. Amongcounty officials distinguished: in Poltava - F.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Opposition activity zemstva</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From inception zemstvapart of open, partial to their duties seriously got down to businessdevelopment of the economy, health care, education, veterinaryservice, communications, insurance, statistics and more. Already the first steps zemstva foundtheir limited jurisdiction, on the other hand - found horrible picturesituation of most of the population. For real cases sometimes had togo beyond their permitted activities. In most cases, not providedlaw of zemstva regarded as seditious by the government and not allowed.During the 1866-1868 biennium zemstvo were put under strict controlgovernors. There have been banned zemstvo establish connections between themselves andmake decisions about government regulations. In this way the royal governmenttried to prevent the transformation of cells zemstva opposition.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite these limitations, somezemstvo influenced by their liberal did not leave of open and productive worktried to develop common measures for tackling the causes of unsatisfactoryfinancial position of the peasantry. For example, vowels ChernihivProvince Zemstvo I. Petrunkevich and Karpinskiyy for 1869-1875 bienniumtheir requests, appeals, complaints raised concerns about chronichunger and rural Mhlynskoho Surazkoho counties, offered to overestimate theirland, reduce redemption money, organize savings and loan office, and Artelrelocated to other counties nayzlydennishyh.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the end of the 70&#39;s fellmost active phase of earthly movement, it gained political overtones. Thiscontributed to both external factors (activation of the national liberation movementsBalkan peoples, the Russian-Turkish war 1877-1878 biennium) andinternal (populist and deployment of the Ukrainian national-culturalmovements, anti-Ukrainian policy Tsars).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the period leading figureszemskoye movement sought to unite all forces that stood for constitutionalrestructuring of the Russian Empire. The desire to consolidate power manifested incounty meetings and congresses that took place in the 1878-1879 biennium Initiators ofvowels were known Chernihiv province zemstvo Petrunkevich I.,A. Lindfors, A. Karpinsky, M. Konstantinovich et al.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In early 1878 Zemstvocommon language with Gromadovtsi and decided to convene Congress in Kharkiv, under the pretextanniversary H.Kvitky-Osnovianenko (100 anniversary of birth). Meeting in KharkovZemstvo launched a political organization. It was agreed force the unionall forces in the struggle to implement the constitution in Russia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Revitalization of schoolopposition to the king favored treatment community to assist the Government inagainst &quot;sedition&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. As compensation for the assistance demanded Zemstvoa representative body, the introduction of the constitution and declarationdemocratic freedoms.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In December 1878 in Kievthe meeting of representatives of Chernihiv Zemstvo, populists, hromadamen,Polish bodies</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#39;organizations. The meeting Zemstvoproposed to unite all forces that are fighting for constitutional changes inRussian Empire, but demanded that the populists renounce terrorismfighting methods. The meeting ended without result.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unable to achieve unificationall opposition forces Zemstvo resorted to consolidate their ranks. In early April1879 Moscow representatives of the five county assembly (Chernihiv,Kharkiv, Poltava, Tver and Samara provinces) convened a congress, whichwas organized to draw up a local movement within the Russian Empire. But that does nothappened.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nevertheless, the struggle for Zemstvoconstitutional reforms gave the results. February 12, 1880 createdsupreme managerial committee headed by Interior MinisterM.Loris-Melikov, who had to draft future constitutional reforms.This has inspired a local movement. Zemstvo at its meetings and conventions developed andapprove various projects of reform and sent them to the Commission or the king. Theyproposed introduction of a broad government, a representativelegislature - the State Duma and more. But all these proposals afterkilling the king remained unfulfilled. Figures of the Provincial Government of motion wererepression. Attempts to organize a wide propaganda of their ideas through the organizationjournal &quot;Volnoe word&quot; also failed. Zemsky movement as liberal,remained amorphous up to the Revolution of 1905</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So, opposition activity zemstvabasically was legal and peaceful. They used the following methods and forms:statements of requirements and proposals for various meetings, congresses, meetings, press;overcoming petitions, appeals and requests to higher authorities and to the king.</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;In Ukraine, my homeland, theregone almost half my life? I connected with Ukraine not onlycool ideas of law and political unity of Russia, but also feelings that entrenchedin blood, in the memories and impressions of nature sounds in popular language, in all thatimposes an unforgettable stamp on the person and indicates its national origin. ButAll these local effects do not obstruct me in all the motherland and the unity of Russiafor me not only the state or the idea of coexistence of two nationalities, but alive andindivisible whole that has its wonderful artistic and excellent displaysuch gifted people as Gogol and Korolenko, where Ukrainian and Russian,as an individual and universal, reflected with extreme clarity. Try to separatethem from Russian Ukrainian: will not work neither one nor the other, lives will betransformed into a lifeless &quot;.</span></p>
