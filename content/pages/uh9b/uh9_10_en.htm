<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. The emergence of organizations in the DecembristUkraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Opposition sentiment thatdistributed to the Russian imperial elite, found expression in the emergence ofsecret organizations among army officers. Members of these organizationscalled the &quot;Decembrists&quot; by the Russian name of the month, which was theirattempted coup of December 14, 1825 in St. Petersburg. Ondistribution of these attitudes influenced acquaintance with inhabitants of European ideas andsocial and political life of Europe during overseas trip1813-1814 biennium Autocratic, feudal empire in order contrasted withwhat they saw and encouraged the nobility, who, after victory in the war feltown importance, decisive action.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Among the officers located atRight Bank after the withdrawal from Europe, 2 nd Army in Kamenetz-Podolskthere was a secret organization &quot;Iron Rings&quot; (1815). Company, a leaderwhich was W. Rajewski, elimination of feudal united supportersprocedures and the introduction of the republican form of government.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">All secret society Decembristsdeveloped a political program, which was outlined their vision of the principles of restructuringRussian Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Ukraine in the policy documentsDecembrist</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The program of future reforms&quot;Southern Company&quot; - &quot;Ruska Pravda&quot; produced Pavel Pestel. Heproject of empire had become a unitary republic with a unicameral parliament.However, for an unlimited period to implement these changes in the countrymilitary dictatorship introduced the &quot;Provisional government&quot; headed byPestel. The people guaranteed basic civil liberties, abolished serfdom.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the same time refused Pestelrecognize the people to live in the empire, the right to separate existence as states.All nations were to merge with the Russian people, that is losing its nationalfeatures. Future Power, in his opinion, should be centralized countrybecause the federal system Pestel considered harmful. For Ukraine, which forit was only &quot;Little Russia&quot;, no public rights is not recognized. Through itsweakness - he said - &quot;Little&quot; can never become a separate state, andIt must give up those dreams. The right to own statehood recognized Pestelonly in Poland, and then only on condition that its close alliance with Russia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another vision for the future leader of the empire&quot;Northern Society&quot; M. Vorobyev. In its &quot;Constitution&quot; as he considered Russiafederal constitutional monarchy with a march on the U.S. model. Serfdomabolished, carried out democratic reforms. Country divided into 14federal states, two of which - the Black Sea with the capital Kiev andUkrainian with its capital in Kharkiv created the Left and Slobozhanschine.All issues of domestic life Ukrainian states have the right to decideindependently. In the center kept the right of a common foreignpolicy issue of money and creation of unified armed forces. Project M. Muravyovagave more rights to people, captive empire, however, the present stateindependence none of them received. States that they planned to createin Ukrainian lands were artificial in nature, since not all coveredterritories inhabited by Ukrainian, and tore it into several pieces of land.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In policy documents&quot;Society of United Slavs&quot; (&quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;sacramental promise&quot;)proclaimed the abolition of serfdom and the democraticrepublican system. Unlike other Decembrist organizationsCompany put forward the idea of liberation of the Slavic peoples of the monarch autocracyand combining them into a federation of Slavic republics. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Programming documents Decembriststestified that although Ukrainian lands were the main arena of the activities of organizationsUkrainian issue, they actually ignored.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Speech Decembrists and its implications</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Decembrist movement was primarilypro-nature and limited Army. He revealed that social movement toUkrainian lands can not win unless supported Ukrainian. PoliticalDecembrists indifference to the future of Ukrainian people (and otherpeoples oppressed Empire) led, among other reasons, to defeatDecembrists. Yet the Decembrist movement, despite its limitedcharacter, was the first in a new era attempt to eliminate autocracy, soinfluenced the development of Ukrainian national liberation movement.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. The Polish uprising of 1830-1831 biennium andUkraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1830 Ukrainian landsfound themselves in a whirlwind of events connected with Polish nationalist uprisingagainst Russian domination, which began in the Polish Kingdom. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Established in Warsaw as a resultThe national government uprising victory put the program revival SpeechesCommonwealth&#39;s borders in 1772 In the Polish proposal to start negotiationsEmperor Nicholas replied that the rebels may consider only two of hisSummary: surrender or destruction. Then polish the rebels have put forward the famousslogan: &quot;For Your Freedom and Ours!&quot; They were counting on the union to fightagainst imperial oppression of all opposition forces from public Russian, Ukrainian,Belarusians, Lithuanians. On the Right Bank, they called on landowners at leastpromise to give land to peasants to engage them on their side, but mostPolish nobility rejected this proposal.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In support of the insurgents weregroups of Polish nobility of the Right Bank. Ukrainian peasantry believed their actionspurely &quot;business lords, and to persuade him to joinPolish nobles, slogans alone was not enough.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Russian government at first appearedin deep water, but very quickly created a way out.Chief of Russian forces, Field Marshal F.Osten-Saken addressedUkrainian peasants Right Bank. &quot;Do not believe them (ie Polish) - he called - andthose who would persuade and compel an uproar, and try to grab dopravytyauthorities. You never will belong to those landowners who stand upagainst legitimate authority. &quot; Contents of this appeal, which was read in all churchesRight Bank, farmers realized an opportunity to break free from the landlord&#39;s yoke.They gladly took the rebellious nobles, and handed them the Russian authorities.At the same time the imperial government decided, as in all previous battles,use military talents descendants of Ukrainian Cossacks. Appeared imperialorder to establish the Little Russian Cossacks regiments in Chernihiv andPoltava provinces. Those wishing to join them turned out a lot, because it wasstated that they will remain at the Cossack service. For six weeksLittle Russian governor-general <b style="">NikolaiRepnin</b> (1778-1845) formed the eight regiments of 1 thousand persons in each. However, insuppressing insurrection Cossack regiments to take part did not have time.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile, Russian troops inJune 1831 suppressed the rebellious Polish nobility speeches on the Right Bank,and early September storm captured Warsaw. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. Imperial Politics in the Dnieperafter suppressing the Polish uprising</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The revolutionary events that sweptEurope, and Polish revolt 1830-1831 biennium Nicholas led and deployedstruggle against the European plague. As aptly expressed about Nicolayhe tried truncated all chairperson, who vyvyschuvalys above average level.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">History of Cossack regiments, formedLittle Russian governor-general, has ended. Part of the Cossack regimentstransferred to the local parts of the Russian army, and most were sent toCaucasus to die in the war by conquering empire of freedom-loving mountain people. Ofthose who tried to protest, dozens died in shpitsrutenamy. HimselfRepnin was dismissed.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nicholas Repnin</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> itsLittle activity as governor-general is very remarkablefrom among the other royal officials in the Dnieper. He was of the oldprincely family Chernigov Rurik dynasty. His whole life was devoted Repnincivil and military service, has reached very high positions, but also earnedFame and liberal supporter of Ukrainian interests. The origins of the many miraclesPrince contemporaries associated with its romantic story of love and marriage withgranddaughter of the last Ukrainian hetman Kirill Razumovsky. Repnin wasnot only highly educated man, but, as evidenced by his work, and courageousdecent.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the period of tenureLittle Governor-General (1816-1834 biennium) he pretty much made fordevelopment of the land. Repeatedly Repninu had, on narazhayuchysirritation metropolitan bureaucracy defend Ukrainian interests beforeimperial government. He also maintained friendships with manynobles-autonomists and, as some claimed, was even a member of the PoltavaMasonic Lodge &quot;Love of Truth.&quot; Many did Repnin developmentUkrainian culture. Suffice it to say his assistance Kotlyarevskyi,organization of the theater in Poltava, who were treated at the scene plays Kotlyarevskyi,written in Ukrainian. On the initiative of Little Governor-Generalwere collected funds for the redemption of serfdom talented Ukrainian actorSchepkin. He is also interested in the history of Ukraine, made a proposal to itswriting and helped historian D.Bantysh-Kamensky make his plan (evenpersonally wrote the section on military history in his Istoriia Malaya Russia &quot;).Repnin and saw the plight of the Ukrainian peasantry, which prompted him to applywith proposals to Nicholas I.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Repnin activity and itsconnections with the Decembrists displeased the emperor. When the &quot;supporters&quot;Governor-General wrote the denunciation and once accused him that henot dissolve established Cossack regiment, since becoming a hetman, suspiciousEmperor decided to act. Under the pretext of financial abuse (it invested its owninvestment in building in Poltava Institute of Noble girls when stateused to the end!) deposed him from office. In his final years he lived in his RepninYagotin estate, where many times visited Shevchenko. Prince treated the poetvery sympathetic, and his daughter fell in love with Barbara T. for life.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Significant changes were madeimperial government on the Right Bank. After the rebellion of the formertolerant attitude towards Poles language was not. Specially created in 1831Commission for Western provinces had by order of Nicholas I &quot;bring allwestern lands in line with the Great provinces in all fields.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consequently, the unfoldedlarge-scale campaign of forcible Russification of the region. The Russian language becamethe sole official language, and within a few months on her teaching was transferredPolish schools and all proceedings on the Right Bank. Kamenetsky Lyceum, which wascenter of Polish culture and higher education, eliminated. His library (50thousand volumes) and most teachers had been transferred to the established in 1834University of Kiev, which was conceived imperial ideologues had&quot;Promote Russian culture and Russian nationality in the lands spolschenyhWestern Russia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Brutal repressionsubjected the Polish nobility. Although directly in the revolt of 100 thousand noblesRight Bank was attended by only 4 thousand warriors, deprived estates and removedPatrician of 64 thousand people. On the right bank were also closed significantnumber of Catholic and Greek Catholic churches and monasteries. Ukrainianfarmers appreciated for their assistance Empire never succeeded. Though I do not blamewas for that: just promised that they no longer belong to the landowners rebels.Indeed, instead of confiscated estates, new masters -therefore, words are not broken ...</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Polish patriots attemptedresistance to imperial policy. In 1835 Radical leader of the Polish&quot;Young Poland&quot; Shimon Konarskyy illegally moved to Volyn and startedpreparation of a new uprising. Over the next two years, he created theRight Bank developed a network of secret organization &quot;CommonwealthPolish people. &quot; However, a new attempt was unsuccessful uprising. In1838 Konarskoho seized and executed the following year.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the first halfNineteenth century. Right bank of the Ukrainian population was in a difficultposition and, being under the hammer on anvil, navperemin suffered frompolonization and Russification. Both sides tried to play the &quot;Ukrainianmap &quot;to establish its authority in the land, completely ignoring the lawindigenous Ukrainian population to self-development.</span></p>
