As a result of the events Russianinvaded lands of Southern Ukraine? <b style="">2</b>.What qualities inherent in feudal-serf and market methods of management?</span></p>

<p class="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Settling the Southern Ukraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Colonization of the Southern Ukraine wasimportance for the history of the nineteenth century. because at this time there actuallythere was great social experiment. South was the economic groundEmpire, where detection and new economic model: the gradual displacementfeudal order due to economic benefitsfree &quot;labor.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Russian Empress Catherine IIannounced in a special document that the land zaselyatymutsya only freecolonize. For their own benefit the Russian government for a long time &quot;not noticed&quot; thatin southern Ukraine fleeing serfs and lords not facilitated the return of slavesto the old masters.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1796 empressCatherine II signed a decree under which the peasants of the South were to remain on theplaces where they lived at the time. Although the law usually interpreted as extending serfdomrights to the South, the results of its implementation were paradoxical. Actually,He freed the serfs, fugitives who settled in new lands, depending onformer owners and hindered the spread is subject to general orders&quot;Personal property&quot;. <b style="">This policywas the first attempt to limit serfdom in the Russian Empire</b> and possiblyfirst awareness of inadequacies in the top of the whole imperial serfdommanagement system. And it should be noted that serfdom in Southernlands completely abolished was not. Landowners can establish their ownserfs, but their number was always negligible. In 1861 only one tenthof land in southern landowners estates treated serfs, the rest -camp follower employees.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">The value of the South for economic development was to Naddniprianshchynathat it was drafting new economic factor in the relationships betweenindividual regions.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Inheritance oflast century, a focus on economic ties left bank of Russia andRight Bank of Poland. Due to successful economic development inNineteenth century. South became a center of economic gravity, repositioningtrade relations and the Left Bank Right Bank Ukraine. Concomitant neweconomic system, connected through the Azov-Black Sea ports with the worldproducers.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the mid-nineteenth century. contradictionbetween the economically backward regions, where the dominant forced labor of serfs andfreedom on the periphery of the empire worsened. This was one of the factors thatprompted the Russian government to go for the abolition of serfdom in the empire1861 The contribution of the South in a feasibility peasant reformlies in the fact that its inhabitants with their jobs unaochnyly advantage of new economicmodel based on free labor personally manufacturers.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Development of South Ukraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the early colonization of landSouthern Ukraine leading sector economy was raising. It does notrequired a significant investment of funds (excluding acquisition costs of animals) and guaranteedquick returns. Natural conditions contributed to breeding Black Sea steppessheep. Sheep wool was the main export commodities of the South in the early developmentthese lands. Sent it by sea, to the factories of Europe and America, as well ascarts to Moscow. In 1825 from Black Sea ports were taken 40 thousandpounds of wool, and 16 years of its exports to the border has increased six times and wonsecond largest after wheat.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Along with the significant place of sheepeconomy at South occupied cattle farming livestock. Greatcustomers were inside the Empire&#39;s army and navy. Meanwhile in huge demand onglobal market enjoyed livestock products, particularly fat (fat) withwhich made soap and candles. It was the largest buyer of England.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other agriculturalproduct, which began to enjoy strong demand, was wine. Viticulturewas one of the most common classes inhabitants of the South. Raising tariffsfor imported wine has created favorable conditions for the development of local production.It was in the first half of the nineteenth century. in the vicinity of Odessa and solar mountainslopes of the Southern Crimea have grape plantations, which are then brought honorthe land. The foreigners thought that the Crimean wines, especially champagne, surpasshigh quality wines of France. The annual sale of Crimean wines reached early30&#39;s Nineteenth century. record figure - 12 million bottles.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Changes in demand on world market(Falling prices for wool in connection with the breeding of sheep in Australia and increased demandbread) contributed to the championship in the economy gradually took over the Southcereals.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fertility of Southernblack allowed to get very high yields. In officialdocuments saved messages in 1835 grain harvest in the South&quot;Exceeded the amount of grain sown twenty times. This yieldshappened, of course, not every year, but significantly more than the usual normin their regions. In natural fertility, and contributed to growing cropsplenty of free land. Growing demand for wheat abroadled to the development of these lands.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">South also had largeopportunities to promote economy and neighboring lands duetrade. Major role in transporting grain from the Right Bank and Left BankUkraine played Chumakov. According to foreigners in the first decadeNineteenth century. to Odessa, the main port of the South, just a day came from500 to 1000 wagons. This method remained the main cargo to the appearancerailways.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Features of social relations inSouthern Ukraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the first halfNineteenth century. population due to migration of the South grew more rapidlythan other regions of the Dnieper area. Number of taxable persons in maleSouth Ukraine was in 1795 520 thousand, 1850 1 millionThe peculiarity of these lands was that new arrivals have not experienced the usualsystem of agriculture, as in other areasEmpire, where this system was based on serfdom. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, free to own land asit was, say, the American Wild West, many settlers did notcould. Most of the villagers working on state or private lands,owned by the imperial nobility.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Characterized population of the Souththe early nineteenth century. was slight spread of serfdom. In 1801 amongpeasants who worked on state and private lands, there were serfsonly 6,5% of all residents. This trend is preserved in the middle of the century.Owner of the estate interested in the rapid development of economy, understoodinefficiency of serf labor and relied on &quot;free&quot;.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">According to the 1857 allthree provinces of South Ukraine number of serfs was less thanone of the Kiev province.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A concrete example of new farmrelations in the South may be business Novorossiysk Governor-GeneralCount Vorontsov. He carried with estates in Central Russia, and placed onSouth of his serfs, while turning them into tenants. Contemporaries whovisited the possession count, certify that all villagers living asAmerican farmers. They are not burdened with forced labor, and simply payrents and processing. Under these conditions, they believed, farmers work the land better, thatbeneficial for both farmers and the owner, and in general for the state. In all areasits huge economy - agriculture, livestock farming,Winery - Vorontsov relied mainly on wage labor. New Modeleconomy, created earl in his possession, followed the thenthe Western capitalist system of agriculture.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A characteristic feature of the economySouth was the prevalence of small estates. Most are owned and commonerssmall traders, who were together typical middle layer, or the petty bourgeoisie.Meanwhile, in other provinces of the empire, which dominated feudal relationsthere were huge estates with thousands of souls bond.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Odessa - a city of a new era</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Center of Southern Ukraine,capital of New Russia was founded in 1794 Odessa. In the midst of large citiesmodern Europe it is one of the youngest. Still, none of them cancompared to Odessa for growth in the nineteenth century.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The emergence of Odessa is concerned withconsequences of the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791 biennium Losers Turkeywas forced to give Russian Black Sea coast between the South and the BugDnestr. These lands occupied the Turkish fortress of Yeni-Danube (New Danube) inHadzhibey area, captured one of the favorites of the Russian EmpressCatherine II, the Spaniard &quot;soldier of fortune&quot; Jose</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">де</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ribas. Onlocation of this fortress by the Empress was laid a city that had becomemain port and the center of a new imperial province, named Novorossiia.The main builders of the city has become the de Ribas, whose name was and still is one ofmain streets of Odessa - Deribassovskaya. Developed first painted planmeet the then Western European urban traditions. Streets peredilyalycity into separate rectangular blocks. The plan also provided the major highwayand free space for movement outside. The administrative center of the cityhad become the seafront.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Odessa Development providedport construction, Admiralty, barracks, private homes, churches,public buildings, gardens, markets, etc.. Two years after the beginningconstruction of the city appeared Stock Exchange building and censorship - personificationof contemporary commercial and cultural life.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Appearance of Odessa, in the opiniontravelers, the city resembled a new American West. However, thissimilarity vycherpuvalasya because Odessa residents had very limited opportunityto participate in urban governance. Chairman of the city administration wasmayor, appointed directly by the emperor, but was subjecthe Governor-General New Russia. For Odessa characteristic was that unlikefrom other imperial cities of its administration became more autonomy thanexpected. There was much less bureaucratic procedures, typicalcities of central provinces.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The population of Odessa was extremelymotley for national and social composition. The first settlers were ofpreferably free or those that considered themselves free. One historian estimatedthe end of XVIII century. third of the residents of Odessa were illegalmigrants. Dilemma - recover fugitives owners or use oftheir work - the imperial government decided in its favor. Manyamong the people of Odessa were foreign immigrants. There were many Greeks,Albanians, Moldova, Jews, Italians, Germans, Armenians, Serbs and others.The imperial government promised religious tolerance to all immigrants, each houseFamily and loan in order to start a new life. For ten years they were exemptedfrom all duties and services and of military duty - forever.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the early nineteenth century. appearanceOdessa was far from in the plan and it resembled, as was consideredcontemporaries rather pirated colony than decent city. Embodied most planslife in new governor general Novorossiia mayor and city <b style="">Duke (Duke) de Richelieu </b>(1767–1822).</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">French immigrant ArmanEmmanuel du Ples - Duc de Richelieu was a descendant of a prominent noblekind. His pradyadkom was famous Cardinal Richelieu. For eleven yearshis rule city and all Novorossiia he won wide recognition forabroad and in the empire as a prudent statesman. His reputation in Russia wasunblemished and neshytnoyu. Emperor Alexander said of him thatPerhaps the French Revolution was not such a bad thing, because if itRussia has Richelieu.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the main resultsRichelieu was the building of Odessa. Then it turned intoelegant city, built up like a contemporary Westernarchitecture. There is a theater that his Odessa compared with Parisopera. Between the sea and the port of Duke ordered the construction of boulevards, where opening has excellentsea view.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Richelieu strongly promoted the planting ofcity. Duke brought his own expenses from Vienna acacia and distributed them to everyonewho promised them to plant and care. Odessa and now known for its uniquewhite acacias. The most famous urban park was the &quot;Garden at Duke, where gathered Richelieusamples of various local and foreign flowers and plants. The mainbuildings in the city were an Orthodox cathedral, school, hospital, collegefinishing school. Guests Odessa wondered how during the presidency of Dukechanged the city.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In his memoirs, summingmade up, Richelieu wrote that when he came to Odessa, lived here7-8 thousand souls in 400 homes. After 11 years, when the Duke left the city, itspopulation grew to 35 thousand and the number of houses - to 2600.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Grateful citizens chargedsculptor Ivan Martos cast in bronze statue of Duke. Completed1828, and it now adorns the top of the Potemkin stairs that leaddown to the coast. Dressed in a toga handy ruler indicates sea vyriznyayuchythus one of the main sources of wealth.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During 1815-1861, the Odessacontinued to grow rapidly and become a city naynaselenisheDnipro region, and significantly - thanks to immigrants. Contemporariessaid that in Odessa speak twenty languages and practicing ten religions.Such multi-way enchanting travelers, the city providedunique look.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The multinational composition of the populationidentified and the specific social and political life. Various ethnic communitieswere the reason that in Odessa has never been united and effectivepolitical community. The city, for example, operated a Greek companynational liberation. Beside them, their secret group created by Bulgarian andPolish, Ukrainian and Russian patriots-conspirators Decembrists. The compositionformed in 1817 Masonic Lodge &quot;Pontus Euxine&quot; went even the governor-generalEarl O. Lanzheron. No wonder foreigners believed Odessa most free city of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In St. Petersburg, for example,Smoking allowed on the streets, walking in nezascheplenyh frock and even -wear a flower in the lapel. Draw the people with glasses or a beard meantsuspicion in radical sentiments. In Odessa, on the contrary, young people walked inthe most fashionable European dress, and even burned trooper. On the streets resoundedmusic and merry voices - this relaxed atmosphere was simply impossiblein the imperial capital. Nicholas thought Odessa &quot;nest of conspirators.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Trade Development</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The main source of prosperity asacross South of Ukraine and its main port - Odessa was trade.The main product in the heyday of trade was grain. Large grain producers withRight Bank and the Provinces of South dopravlyaly wheat to Odessa - mainPort Empire grain trade. Grain trade steadily increased. In1795 Black Sea in search of grain crossed and entered the Port of Odessaonly 39 ships, in 1815 - 1500 ships.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On the demand forBlack Sea wheat influenced by various European events. When in 1814in France during the Hundred Days &quot;Napoleon tried to restore power, unexpectedmobilization of large armies sharply increased demand for Ukrainian grain.South Ukraine also helped her overcome agriculturalEuropeans threat of starvation in the lean years. Historians called the 1816,when the terrible rains destroyed grain fields of Europe, &quot;the last major foodcrisis &quot;of European history. It is then exhausted to the Napoleonicwars of Europe a terrible ghost of hunger, fortunately, was usefulBlack Sea wheat.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So, in the first halfNineteenth century. South Ukraine became part of the world grain market. Achieve thisshe could, especially because the region was the prevalence of neweconomic relations.</span></p>
