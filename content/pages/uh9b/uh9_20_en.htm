<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Features of Economic DevelopmentNaddniprianshchyna reform before 1861</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Late 50-iesDnepr Ukraine was the most developed economic region in the planeRussian Empire. But further economic development is increasingly hinderedexistence of serfdom. The development industry resisted no marketfree &quot;labor and narrow demand for industrial products. Existenceserfdom also hindered the process of stratification of the peasantry and the formationsocial strata of rural entrepreneurs and rural laborers. Besidesurban entrepreneurs and merchants could not buy land because itwas the subject of free buying and selling.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In mid-century graduallyokreslyuvatysya started new paths of economic specialization of regionsNaddniprianshchyna. In the forefront of the South took the place of sheepwheat for export. On the left bank of the remoteness of marketsgrain production caused in the southern part of the main transformationsource of livestock income in the northern - flax and tobacco industry.Significant gains landowners Left Bank gave distilling. Right Bank in40-ies become a main area of sugar production. Reductionshare of farms in the Right Bank and grain development tsukroburyakovohoproduction reflects the changes that took place in the economyNaddniprianshchyna.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the first halfNineteenth century. When accustomed lands of the South, there prevailed sheep, holdersRight Bank estates specializing in growing corn, which soldthrough the Black Sea ports. Grain economy was based on the Right Bankserfs working in the South - dominated the use of free-workforce. With sales of grain to most of the owners estates Right Bankaccumulated considerable resources and, at the same time, taking away land from peasants in grain,caused the appearance of a large number of landless serfs. Thereforelandlords, based on existing demand, invested in building sugarfactories and laid beet plantations, employing landless peasants.The development also contributed to the production tsukroburyakovoho good natural conditions,large forests, which gave fuel for factories and protectional Russian politicsgovernment. All this provided saharozavodchika high profits.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first the sugar industrywas mainly landlord. Gradually, her allowing a merchant capital. Butmerchants were unable to use free labor and serfs wereattract laborers. In the mid-nineteenth century. in Dnieper Ukrainemerchants, entrepreneurs rented 24 sugar factories and the land around them.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So tsukroburyakova Industrygained market character and their contents become the direct opposite ofdominant feudal system of management. The development of sugar industrycaused changes in other sectors. Requirements for further developmenteconomy called for the elimination of serfdom.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Background of the peasant reform</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Peasant and other reforms60-70&#39;s in the Russian Empire had the character of delayed modernizationcarried out under the pressure of historical circumstances. Its implementation empirepushed a few historical conditions:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">furtherexistence of serfdom empire threatened to turn into a secondarycountry, as eloquently testified her defeat in the Crimean War. Peasant movementUkrainian provinces in the late war, constant demands release of villagerstsarism by all the opposition organizations, impacts of elimination of serfdomWestern Ukraine in 1848 - all of which also contributedtransformation problem abolition of serfdom in urgent need of further developmentEmpire;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">serfdominhibited the rate of economic development. Presence in the Empireregions such as South, convincingly proves the advantages of free-labor, however, caused numerous inconsistencies between the relations which are hereexisted, and order in other parts of the empire. However, the landlords&#39; farmsgave about 50% of commodity grain, and their rapid and simultaneous elimination couldproduce catastrophic consequences;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">serfdomin form and content too seemed to slavery. Immorality possession &quot;baptizedproperty &quot;zasudzhuvalasya overwhelming majority of representatives of different socialgroups. Besides the example of European monarchies, which eliminated the ringlaw, testified that the act does not shake thrones of monarchs, but rather strengthenedthem and opened the possibility of accelerating social and economic development.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Social Movement for Reform</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Opinions about the necessity of eliminatingserfdom increasingly spread among all strata of the Ukrainiansociety. Understanding of serfdom as a big social disaster caused the appearancepassionate poetry of Taras Shevchenko and prose works of the young Ukrainianwriter Mark spinner. They, according to contemporaries, was &quot;one hugeThe charges against serfdom slavery.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the same time demands are not heardconfined to the release of the peasants. In his letter to the editor of the Russianemigre journal Bell in London Nikolai Kostomarov in generaltreating positive intentions of the imperial government to abolish serfdom, rosealso to ensure that the rights of peasants urivnyaty of nobles and create conditions for unhindereddevelopment of Ukrainian language as the basis of Ukrainian cultural solution. He alsoexpressed the need for a Ukrainian state as part of itsSingle Slavic Union.</span></p>

Among the landowners were also a lot of thosewho held liberal positions.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">According to &quot;Regulations&quot; all farmerswere to join in the community (community) - a form of peasantgovernments, which were based on common economic interests. Allotmentland was given not to individual farms and communities.

However, most conciliator was itselflandlords and protect their own interests first, sometimes even againstlaw.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Central to the reformoccupied on the ground. Acts of reform based on the recognition by landownersownership of all land in the estates, including the farmers&#39; holdings.The farmers declared by users of the land, bound by her vidroblyatyestablishing &quot;Regulations&quot; duties - servage or serfdom. Totake ownership of their inheritance, a farmer had to buy itlandowner. Dimensions duties and plots were established for each areaseparately, depending on the quality of land. In the South, was installed only &quot;ukazna&quot;rule of inheritance - from 3 to 6.5 acres. On the left bank is higher portion sizewas 2,7-4,5 tithes, lower - half high. For farmersRight Bank were tied to put in those sizes, marked by &quot;inventoryrules &quot;1847-1848 biennium On average, farmers receive tithes 1,9-2,3land.

It causeneed for the Russian government to win over villagers after suppressionPolish uprising of 1863-1864 biennium Overall size of the peasantland use in bank Ukraine was reduced after the reform by 27%.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Given that, accordingeconomists to ensure the minimum needs of a farm (theplay and pay numerous taxes) needed at least 5 acresland, the vast majority of Ukrainian peasants did not receive this required standard.In addition, many serfs engaged in household landlordsdismissed without allocation of land.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Changes in the position of state peasants</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;Regulations&quot; peasant reformextended to the former serfs. However, significant changes took place instatus of state peasants, who accounted for 44% of all peasants Dnieper.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This category of populationbelonged to the former Cossacks, military settlers, the colonists of the South. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">According to the decree in 1866 allground state peasants, while remaining the property of the state, tied to therural communities in perpetual use (Podvirna or public).Farmers had to pay for it annually to the treasury &quot;Obrochne submit.State farmers had the right to become owners of plots by the payment of their ransomfor 8 years, but the size of their holdings installed no more than 8-15acres. As a result of this reform exercise which lasted 20 years, the situation of publicpeasants became slightly better than the former serf. Grant, whom they receivedwere on average twice as large than in the former serfs. In 1886 allstate peasants were obliged to redeem their holdings, but the redemption money for themwere significantly lower than serfs. Hindered the development of economystate rural communities with the introduction of shared responsibility for paymenttaxes.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In much better conditions wereSouthern colonists. Having big to put reform, they have kept them and following it,and got all sorts of benefits. For example, they paid two to three timesless &quot;Obrochne submit&quot; than other state farmers. The vast majority of farmscolonists was by its nature, large farms, whichwidely used agricultural equipment and camp followerpower, rented, but their plots, large plots of land.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. The peasant reform</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Reform of 1861 causedsignificant changes in the position of peasants, who at that time were the majorityNaddniprianshchyna population. However, because the land here was much better thanin other regions of the empire, it is here that most farmers have lost land due to&quot;Segments&quot;. The introduction of public forms of land ownership and land usetlumylo individual initiative villagers prevented the formation of market relationsin agriculture. The need to pay excessive prices for landprevented farmers develop their own economy. Reform is not created in the rural feelingthat they own the land. Under these conditions, redemption payments were seen asnew tax, rather than as partial payment received for the land.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Still, despite the large number ofdefects in general peasant reform of 1861 have a positive value. Iteliminated the existing obstacles to socio-economic modernization of the empire. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">7. Reform of charge</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Abolition of serfdomled to reforms in local government proceedingsfinance, education, censorship, military affairs. The aim of these measures was tofurther modernization of steps in other areas of life empire. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To improve the systemLocal Government 1864 Zemskov reform was carried out. Behind her incounties and provinces zaprovadzhuvalosya Zemskov (local) government. Itconsisted of a filament (county and province of county fees) andexecutive (county and provincial management of county) agencies. By countyof open meetings elected (MPs) units of different classes - landowners, localowners and farmers. At the county meeting in turn elected vowelsprovince of county fees. Prevailed at the meeting of county landowners.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Dnieper Ukraine actionof school reform covered only the Left Bank and the South. On the Right Bankwas much opposition to the Russian government, the Polish gentry, who participatedin the Polish uprising of 1863 Therefore, fearing that activity zemstvacontribute to a new revival of Polish national liberation movement in the province, theirnot created until 1911</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Zemstvo Naddniprianshchyna graduallytransformed into competent authorities, who conducted a great job invarious areas of local governance. Most cases they are fundedthemselves. Zemstvo created a network of county and provincial agriculturists, organizedactivities to increase farmers rilnytskoyi culture - deliveringseeds, farm machinery, organized courses, exhibitions, readinglectures. Because of their support came peasant cooperative movement, creditinstitutions for farmers. Zemstvo also took care of construction and maintenanceways, the organization&#39;s email service, statistical surveys. They providefood assistance to populations in lean years. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Zemstvo maintained primary andprofessional school training were free. They repeatedlyapproached with a request to Government for implementation in schools in the study of Ukrainianlanguage. Unfortunately, all these requests aside, and teachers who trieduse the Ukrainian language only as a subsidiary since it wasVillagers realized, liberated. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Zemstvo reorganized networkhealth care on principles no charge, the district charactercreate the necessary conditions for inpatient population. One of the biggestachievements of school of medicine was the organization of an effective system to combatepidemics.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Activities zemstva led toin Ukrainian society that they are perceived not only as localgovernments, but also as an organization, opposition to the policy of Russian Tsars.It is from county agencies left many well-known in future Ukrainianpublic figures. Zemstvo Naddniprianshchyna repeatedly treated with petitionsto the Russian government about the necessity of constitutional reforms.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Activities of county agencies hadlarge positive value for Naddniprianshchyna. On the one hand, they became theschool which taught people to the government, on the other - contributedraising national awareness.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">8. City and Financial Reform</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For urban reform in 1870governments in the cities varied from birth to bezstanove. According toAct 1875 in all cities Naddniprianshchyna created municipal councils.Suffrage was given to men of 25 years, but only those who wereproperty owners, commercial and industrial enterprises.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Economic development needsprompted the imperial government to conduct financial reforms. In particular,1860 , the State Bank, which received preferential rightcredit trading and industrial enterprises. In all provinces wereestablished independent of the local administration of the Chamber. These monthlyreviewed the expenditures of all local institutions. With this move, the government tried to somehowresist abuse and bribery, the extent of which in Russia were high.When the emperor once instructed to check which of its executives is notbribes, he reported that only three of fifty refuse &quot;to</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">gifts &quot;, ie not assign local taxespopulation.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was canceled a long otkupnyhsystem for collecting taxes, which the majority of the collected money to the treasury not nahodyla,and pocket leaseholder.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">9. Judicial and military reform</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Conducted in 1864 Judiciaryreform was the most consistent bourgeois character. Because she wasmade an attempt vyvyschyty imperial justice to the level of contemporary legalScience and judicial practice of European countries. Earlier in the Empire existedis, closed, depending on local court administration with the lack ofsecurity charges and red tape. According to new courtbezstanovym court statutes became independent from administrative authorities.The meeting of the judiciary were open to the public.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The central part of the newJustice was the District Court in each province. The prosecution maintainedprosecutor, defended the interests of the defendant&#39;s lawyer. Jurors in the number of12 people were selected randomly from representatives of all states. They heardboth sides, installed, guilty or not guilty of the defendant and the sentencedefined by law, the judge and members of the court.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consideration of minor civil andcriminal cases led magistrate. He chose zemstvo or municipal councils.The local administration had the opportunity to remove from office the magistrate orCourt of the District Court. </span></p>
