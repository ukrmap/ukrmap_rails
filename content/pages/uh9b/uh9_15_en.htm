<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Addressing the peasant question</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The revolutionary wave of 1848forced the Austrian government close approach to solving problems and peasanteliminate remnants of feudal relations.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Summer 1848 increasedpeasant movement in Transcarpathia. Although the peasant reform began in these landsearlier than other regions, peasants were dissatisfied with its implementation.Landowners actually sabotaged the law on the abolition of serfdom, tookforests and pastures.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">10. Ukrainian national liberation movementin our region during the period of &quot;spring people&quot;</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the 1848-1849 bienniumrevolution swept Transcarpathia. Initially welcomed Subcarpathian RutheniansHungarian revolution, laying the hope that it will help them gain their autonomyland within the new Hungary. However, after the overthrow of the Habsburg dynastyRevolution leaders denied the right of peoples to self neuhorskyh. Itthe main reason that the Subcarpathian Ruthenians did not support the Hungarianrebels and abide Habsburgs.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The evidence of a politicizationUkrainian national movement in Transcarpathia was promoting the idea of unificationTranscarpathia from Eastern Galicia and Bukovina in a separate administrative autonomousunit empire. The first publicly spoke about the need to implement thispriest <b style="">Alexander Dukhnovych</b>
(1803–1865).</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This Transcarpathin scientist worthycontinued to fight their predecessors by national and cultural rights Ruthenians.In his creative works - literary, works with education,philosophy and history. The main business of his life he considered a Dukhnovychfundamental work on the history of Subcarpathian Rusyns, but was able to publishonly its main provisions in separate articles. The reason for this interference wereAustrian officials, as in the work of the scientist raised the issue that is notin the interests of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">His view of historyTranscarpathian Rusyns Dukhnovych expressed in the article &quot;State of Rusyns in Hungary,published in 1849 in &quot;Star Galicia. Much of the credit was a scientistthat he not only dared to show the oppressed position of Rusyns, butexpressed his vision of how it should be improved.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the revolution Dukhnovychcontinued efforts to Rusyns &quot;left a deep sleep. In1850-1852 biennium he organized the release of three literary anthologies &quot;CongratulationsRusyn, Galician in journals published many articles about life Transcarpathians,wrote textbooks and literary works. One had to really not only lovehis people, but also have personal courage to prosecution underHungarian authorities in the 50-ies state:</span></p>

<p class="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="sm" style="text-indent: 70.85pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I Rusinwas, ECM and will,</span></p>

<p class="sm" style="text-indent: 70.85pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Iwas born Rusin,</span></p>

<p class="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These words have found a path to the heartTranscarpathians and were a national anthem, which is known throughout the land;appeal to those who united all those who opposed Magyarization Ruthenians.The multi-faceted activities Duhnovicha promoted the inclusion of Transcarpathian Rusyns insingle stream of national revival of the Slavic peoples.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First reunificationRuthenian lands Dukhnovych advanced in article &quot;State of Rusyns in Hungary.The legitimacy of this act Dukhnovych pokriplyuvav that both sides of the Carpathian RusynsMountains belong to one nation. Scientists have warned that if further Rusynsremain disconnected, it can lead to their absorption of other nations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The fight for National policies and culturalrights of their people also Transcarpathin led scholars, social, political andCulture and Education Worker <b style="">AdolfDobriansky</b> (1817–1901).</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dobriansky acquired technical education andworked as an engineer in the Czech Republic, where he can see the political disempowermentSlavic peoples and closer with the Czech and Slovak &quot;adherents.&quot; Ofwhich he took over the idea of Slavic unity.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the revolution Dobrianskyreturned to the Carpathians. At first he supported the Hungarian revolution, but itviews differed significantly from the attitude towards the national issues leadingHungarian Revolution. Then Dobriansky, with DUHNOVICHA, established relationshipswith the Supreme Ruthenian Council and began the struggle for land in association Rusynsingle administrative entity. </span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dobriansky joined the fightHungarian revolution against the Habsburgs. At a critical time for yourself Austrianemperor was forced to seek the assistance of the Russian emperor. InJuly 1849 Russian troops crossed the Carpathian Mountains. The Austrian governmentDobriansky assigned to them as his representative. Hungarian revolution byRussian assistance was suppressed. Probably under the impression these events Dobrianskybegan to think that Russia is the force that can help Rusynsprotect against Magyarization. Even the Habsburgs had to look itassistance. This was the pretext for future charges Dobriansky thathe began a Russophile, or moskvofilskyy, the direction in policy-Transcarpathia life. However Dobriansky should evaluate the positions of the timehistorical reality. In the absence of Ukrainian statehood orientationSlavic Orthodox Russia it was considered the most realistic way to protectMagyarization and stick a catholic faith of Transcarpathian Rusyns.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the &quot;spring people&quot;Dobriansky did not stop their struggle. For this he used hisTranscarpathia&#39;s seat of the Hungarian Parliament. However, theDobriansky repeated statements from the parliamentary rostrum Hungarian officialsanswered that there is no other nation, except Hungarian. Despite differentevaluation Dobriansky, in the second half of the nineteenth century. its contribution toformation of national consciousness Transcarpathian Rusyns in years &quot;spring people&quot;is very significant.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In January 1849 ledDobriansky zakarpatska delegation handed over a petition demanding the emperorcombine eastern Galicia and Transcarpathia in a single political and administrativewhole.
