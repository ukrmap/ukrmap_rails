<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>. What were the location and roleDnieper Ukraine in international relations the first half of the nineteenth century.? <b style="">2</b>. What were the consequencesRusso-Turkish wars that took place late in the first XVIIIhalf of the nineteenth century.? <b style="">3</b>. AsRussian Empire used the human and economic potentialNaddniprianshchyna to implement its expansionist policy in the firsthalf of the nineteenth century.?</span></p>

<p class="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Ukrainian question in the contextEuropean foreign policy</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite the fact that Ukrainelost its statehood, during the nineteenth century. she remained an objectinternational politics. The deployment of the Ukrainian national liberation movementinfluenced the gradual spread among European politicians understand that thissubdued empires people want to live its own national life. SupportUkrainian movement could cause a weakening of the empire and even if hewas a success, the separation from her Ukrainian lands.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the second half of the nineteenth century.search for ways to counter Russian expansionism started especially thosecountries that saw the danger in her attempts to resolve the fate of Europeanpossessions of the Ottoman Empire in its favor. Men among those countriesoccupied Prussian Kingdom. Prussian policy at that time developed the ideaUnion of Prussia, Britain and France to counter Russia&#39;s attempt to strengthen theirposition because of another war against the Ottoman Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When in 1853 Russia launchedCrimean war, some influential Prussian politykystaly speak frankly,Prussia would be useful that &quot;only those policies that will lead to division andweakening Russia. They make the calls that do not have time to make Frederick the Greatand Napoleon, to the historical fate of Dnieper Ukraine meant primarilyopportunity to break free from the power of the Russian Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">German politicians plannedaway from the Russian Empire Finland, the Baltic lands, Poland, SouthUkraine and Bessarabia. These plans showed understanding of European politicsthat the Ukrainian land is not exclusively Russian land, as trying to proveSt. Petersburg authority. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, plans for Prussian politiciansnezrealizovanymy remaining. Despite the fact that the Crimean War is overdefeat of the Russian Empire, victorious did not want to start on itnew war, and peaceful ways to implement the plans division of empireexisted.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ukrainian issue back tointernational politics at a time when &quot;Iron&quot; Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the creatorunited Germany, was to pursue his country&#39;s rightful place in Europeanpolicy. Germany, among others, wanted to consolidate its influence in the OttomanEmpire, which once led to a clash of its claims against Russian interests.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Balkan crisis in 1875caused the Russian-Turkish war 1877-1878 biennium, which was extremelysuccessful for the Russian Empire. Bismarck saw the danger in these events forinterests in Germany. In 1879 Austria-Hungary and Germany concluded an alliancedirected against Russia. At the same time &quot;Iron&quot; Chancellor initiated the appearance of an article inwhich put forward plans for rejection of the Russian Empire captured herlands. Among others, in particular drawing attention to Ukrainian lands, where plannedcreate an independent state - Great Kyiv principality, led bywas to be representative of the Habsburg dynasty. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From the article GermanHartmann philosopher in the German magazine &quot;Hehenvart&quot;</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;There is neither geographical norethnographic reasons for merging the two worlds - the Russian andBelarusian-Ukrainian state in a single organism. Russians inhabitVolga and Don Rivers, so Russia is vital to have these issuesrivers for their whole race, but Russia does not possess the necessary Dniester region -resettlement territory of the Ukrainian and Belarusian people. This river systemseparated from Russia Dvina watershed-Dolsky hills. Sky nowhereaffect Russian territory. So it is no case that both annual basinpopulated by two different nations - Russian and Ukrainian. Russian Nationalstate as in its national character and the geographical conditionsfacing south-east, not west. In every case both partscan do one without the other as the geographical and beyondtrade and political location. Since it follows that after separationfrom Russia, Finland, the Baltic Provinces, Lithuania, Poland should also bea kingdom in Kiev and the Dnieper rivers Prut. This dissertation onstate of 18 million people would have all the necessary prerequisites forindependent political existence. The new state must also be obtained fromAustria immunity and enter it to the alliance.The separation of the territories of Russia with 34 million people finally putend of its expansion in the West ... &quot;</span></p>

<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Judge</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>. What evidence in favor ofself-nominated by the Kingdom of Kiev? <b style="">2</b>. What benefits have hoped for a result of KievKingdom of Germany?</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The plan also found support inofficial circles in Austria-Hungary. The Russian government in response to unfoldedmassive campaign against this dangerous for the future of the empireplans. In the above inspired articles in the Russian press wrote indignantlyheady plans of the German Chancellor. Ukrainian Activistsnational liberation movement in Ukraine Naddnipryanskiy fear of persecutionof the Russian Tsars, express their attitude to these plans could not.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The value of the German plana Grand Duchy of Kiev was very important for Europeaninternational policy and the development of the Ukrainian national movement:</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">it is visualizedsignificant achievements of the Ukrainian national liberation movement. European policyhas focused on bad Ukrainian problems. In 1869French politician, a close friend of Napoleon III, SenatorK.

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Excerpt from the petition inK. Delyamara Ukrainian affairs, introduced by the French Senate</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;In Europe there are people, forgottenhistorians - people Rusyns (Le peuple Ruthene), of which 12.5 million live inby the Russian Emperor, and 2.5 million souls - the former Austro-Hungarianmonarchy. The people by their number of Spaniards is three times greater thanCzechs and equal for all subjects of the Crown sv.Stefana (populationHungary .- <b style=""><i style="">Auto.</i></b>). The people there, has a history that is different from historyMuscovy. It has its own traditions, our language, separate from Moscow andPoland has a distinct personality, which is fighting for preservation. Historyshould not forget that to Peter and the people whom we today callRuthenians, called Rus or Ruthenians, and his land known as Rus orRuthenium, and the people whom we now call Rus, called thenRussians, and their land - Muscovy. Late last century, all inFrance and Europe is well able to distinguish Russia from Muscovy.</span></p>

<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Judge</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>. What the author draws attention to the appeal?<b style="">2</b>. What showed the emergence of suchpublications in Europe at that time?</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the end of XIX - beginningTwentieth century. Europe formed two political blocs States: Triple Alliance (Germany,Austria-Hungary, Italy) and the Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia). Countries TripleUnion positive attitude to the Ukrainian national movement, as sawit factor weakening their enemy. For this to Ukrainian officials,who fought to liberate their homeland from the rule of the Russian Empirefocus on its alliance with the opponents was historically agreed. Therefore,territory of the countries - members of the Triple Alliance Ukrainian leaders had to actquite active, not facing big obstacles on the part of government.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the second halfNineteenth century. Ukrainian question remained part of European internationalpolicy. But Ukrainian, sought help for the liberation of his homeland,that European politicians more interested in this opportunity to thanksown geopolitical plans.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Another attempt to solve the Turkish Empirequestion</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the revolutionary events1848-1849 biennium, when the Russian Empire played a leading role in rescueHabsburgs and the suppression of the Hungarian uprising and its influence and prestige in Europeconsiderably amplified. Based on this, the Emperor Nicholas increasingly insistenttried to solve the issue in their favor redistribution of European holdingsOttoman Empire, which he called &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. However, plansEmperor provoked negative reactions and promote cohesionEuropean countries. In European democracies, growing aversion to the RussianTsars and its role gendarme of Europe. Even before the war, British diplomatsbegan to speak of it as a &quot;battle of civilization against barbarism.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the Crimean War, RussianEmpire fought against the Ottoman Empire and its allies - GreatBritain, France and the Sardinian kingdom. With the war Russia has sought toexpand their knowledge, strengthen influence in the Middle East and BalkanPeninsula. In particular, it claimed to establish protectorate overDanubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia), Bulgaria and Serbia.However, planned control of the straits, which led to the Black Sea to the MediterraneanSea.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, presenting these ambitious plans,Empire has proved its utter failure to understand how European policy, and thosechanges that have occurred in the development of Western civilization during the firsthalf of the nineteenth century. The process of becoming an industrial society in WesternStates led to enhance their economic potential, heatedappetite for conquest of new markets, sources of raw materials and spheres of influence. Under suchfavorable conditions they perceived help in suppressing revolutionary Russiaperformances, but had no desire to agree to its adoption in thoseregions, who claimed to own. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As the dominion of the empireNaddniprianshchyna area was near the rear of the Russian army and the Southfighting took place directly on the Ukrainian population once againfell the main burden of unnecessary war.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. The Crimean War</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">External drives before the war begandisputes between Catholic and Orthodox churches around the custody ofChristian shrines in Palestine. Russian Emperor &quot;offended&quot; atTurkish sultan, when he handed over the right to take care of them Catholics, and inJune 1853 suddenly, without declaration of war, occupied the dependentOttoman Danubian principalities. Instead, the Turkish sultanenlisting the support of Great Britain and France declared war on the RussianEmpire. Turkish troops first fought very poorly and suffered injuries unitsRussian army. Defeated the Turks in the Caucasus, their Black Sea fleet wascompletely smashed the Russian fleet in Synops&#39;ka Bay. The Russians startedpromotion to the border with Bulgaria.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Impact of War on the situation inDnieper Ukraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since Dnepr Ukrainewas not only the family background, but also partly terrain warfare, itseconomy suffered significant losses. Hence also replenished with recruits andRussian army by militias. Results from Dnieper to the ranks of the Russian armywere taken from 750 thousand persons. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the absence of all the railwayssupply the necessary burden fell on the Russian army and mobilized Chumakovwith their carts and cattle farmers. One only Taurian Province1856 for military purposes in the peasants were taken about 150 thousand of the knee.Ukrainian lands laid the basic ways of moving parts of the RussianArmy to the theater of war. Everything needed for the army on its wayrekvizuvalos promotion in the local population.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the South, which was pryfrontovoyuzone, declared martial law. In front of the advancing soldiers, carts armsand ammunition, and thence returning carts loaded wounded and crippledsoldiers. The farmers were taken to war, people had to hold militaryduring Postoj, delivering cattle to carry out various works. Hugeburden of the war devastated the economy of the South.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Great Heath, resembledCemetery, was blooming before the Crimea.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Cossack project Michal Czajkowski</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Losses that are sustained duringCrimean War Russian Empire, led to activation forces, its oppositionpolicy abroad. In Paris the intensified activities of the Polish emigrationled by Adam Czartoryski, who believed in the West &quot;uncrownedking &quot;of Poland. In the environment of Polish emigration formed politicalviews of right-bank nobleman, Polish <b style="">MichalTchaikovsky</b> (1804-1886), who during the Crimean War attemptedimplement its recovery plan Hetmanate.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tchaikovsky was a participant in thy youthPolish uprising of 1830-1831 biennium After his defeat he emigrated and settledin Paris. His political ideal was the revival of the former Cossack Ukraineas an autonomous part within the restored independent Poland. TchaikovskyCossack Ukraine considered the best form of statehood, the embodiment of the Slavicspirit and humanistic ideals. Restoration of the nineteenth century. he imagined possibleand pertinent, believed that this is the right pan weight.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ability to implement their planshe ubachav in collaboration with Adam Czartoryski, who was the initiator of the jointarmed national liberation struggle of oppressed peoples Russia.Tchaikovsky was trying to prepare for his support of anti-Russian uprising, toparticipation in which would attract Polish immigrants in the Caucasian highlandersby Shamil, the descendants of Cossacks zadunaytsiv, Don and Kuban Cossacks.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1841 on behalf ofCzartoryski, he headed east agency in Istanbul and began preparations foruprising. In Dobrogea, populated mostly descendants of the Cossacks, he createdad hoc basis for political propaganda among the population and its shareNaddnepryanschine. Activities displeased Tchaikovsky Russiangovernment, which sought his deportation. To avoid this, he took Turkishnationality and came to Islam. Since Tchaikovsky performed by recoveryHetman under the protection of the Ottoman Empire in the spirit of tradition Doroshenko.He imagined himself a future Ukrainian hetman.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When the Crimean War began,Tchaikovsky saw in it an opportunity to exercise their imaginations. In his proposalSultan allowed to form a Cossack regiment under Turkish command. HeadedThis regiment of Cossacks in 1400 under the name Mirmiram-Pasha himself Tchaikovsky. The compositionregiment of Cossacks, descendants zarahovuvaly zadunaytsiv, deserters from the Russian Army,Bulgarians. Officers were mostly Poles, members rebellion 1830-1831 bienniumAt the insistence of Tchaikovsky as the official language used in his regimentexclusively Ukrainian.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The regiment played a prominent Tchaikovskyrole in the Danube Campaign 1854 Cossacks Mirmiram-pasha took an activeparticipated in the liberation of the Russians surrounded the fortress on the Danube Sylystriya, the firstcame to Bucharest after it left the Russian army. End1854 Tchaikovsky&#39;s regiment went to the border of the Russian Empireon the Prut River. He planned to go to the area and raise there Naddniprianshchynaanti-Russian uprising, but far not materialized. Turkish command andAllies ignored the intentions of Tchaikovsky considered as importantstruggle for mastery of Sevastopol. So when the Austrian troops occupiedDanubian principalities, the regiment Tchaikovsky brought to Bulgaria, where he remainedto end the war.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Cossack project MichalTchaikovsky restore Hetmanate was ambiguous phenomenon. Lump considerhis whimsical tales should not be. During the Crimean War turned peasantmovement called &quot;Kiev Cossacks. The desire to return to Ukrainian peasantsCossack state and become free testified to the existence in the DnieperUkraine the force, which could support the appeal to raise Tchaikovskynational liberation uprising against imperial domination. It is worth to mentionthat he later claimed, allegedly received a message from Dnieper fromsecret anti-Russian organization &quot;Committee of Ukraine and Bessarabia. Theyopposed by the Ukrainian nobility treatedSultan&#39;s request to restore the autonomous Ukrainian Cossack state underprotectorate of the Ottoman Empire. Declaring that they wanted her in those borders,that existed during the hetman Petro Doroshenko, with the amount of rights they had undersultanate Danubian principalities (Wallachia, Moldavia).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yet the draft recoveryHetman in the nineteenth century. had several significant flaws.
