<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Population in the second Naddniprianshchynahalf of the nineteenth century.</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the second halfNineteenth century. population has increased nine provinces Naddniprianshchynafrom 13.5 to 23.5 million souls. This extremely rapid growth was a directresult of population explosion in Europe during the secondhalf of the nineteenth century. Before World War Ukrainian populationprovinces rose to 33 million souls. Most rapidly growingpopulation of the South, where there was rapid development of industry: itsnumber increased from 3.6 million persons in 1858 to 8.8 million in 1897 and 13million in 1914 Urban population Right Bank and Left Bank has increased over this timetripled, South - five times. The vast majority Naddniprianshchyna(22 million souls) were farmers. Industrial workers in late nineteenth century.was about 360 thousand people. For nationally in the late nineteenth century.most of the people Naddniprianshchyna were Ukrainian.The most numerous national minorities were Russians, Belarusians, Jews, Germans andMoldovans. The largest percentage of Russians living in the provinces of the South - 21-27%.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Farmers</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To the Ukrainian peasantry wasthe population, which has kept the popular culture, has seen their mother tongueUkrainian. In the days after reforms in the whole village kept its old appearance. Indifferent regions of the peasants in many ways built and decorated their houses, but theypreserve traditional Ukrainian features. During the second half of the nineteenth century. inamong the poor peasantry dominated housing, consisting of houses andporch. But the wealthy owners are increasingly organized in their homes and even a shed.In the early twentieth century. urban influences have led to what is in the house wereward off the kitchen. Traditional interior design of dwelling no significant changesexperienced. This traditional view of the villages kept Ukrainian Carpathians, inLeft in the villages and established immigrants from the Far NaddniprianshchynaEast.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Traditionally an important place in lifeUkrainian village occupied the peasant community. However, the reform of 1861significantly changed the economic and legal basis for her life. Since then shehas become a grassroots component of the imperial administration. Land allotment whole arrayland belonged to the community, which it distributed among individual peasantfarms. Periodically there were land conversion stages. All members of the communityderived a strip from different fields, resulting cherezsmuzhzhya arose.Having the property of their strip of land, a farmer could sell it with the consentcommunity to give as dowry for his daughter, but it was impossible to usediscretion. The joint entity required subordination peasantcommunities&#39; rotation, which was an unwritten rule of common law, violatewhich was not possible. Woods, pastures, meadows, rivers, springs remain indivisiblecommon ownership community.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Ukrainian dietfarmer no significant changes occurred. The vast majority of peasants ate verypoorly. Mostly they ate cereal, flour meat, potatoes and othervegetables.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At breakfast in the peasant (duringsummer field work - at five o&#39;clock in the morning) were borscht and kasha; southward -porridge, soup, etc. supper mostly potatoes with bacon. Food overwhelmingmost villagers was simple and monotonous. However, many impoverished peasantscould afford it. That is why the average level of consumption of Ukrainianremained far behind the leading European population. EndNineteenth century. Dane consumed annually, on average, 2166 pounds of bread,German - 1119, Magyar - 1264, Russian - 1086. And in the granaryEurope, as they named Naddnipryanshchyna, average consumption wasonly 867 pounds.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Late 60 70&#39;sUkrainian peasantry began to use metal tools factory.Widely used new iron plows and plows with iron parts, which vpryahalyhorses. Replacement bulls horses increased productivity of land under cultivation inthree, and in transportation of grain - four times. Agricultural Plantsmachinery produced cultivators, steam threshing and other implements.However appliances were able to use only the wealthy economy.In the late nineteenth century. in Dnieper Ukraine, a huge number of mechanicalmills, which gradually displaced the old windmills and water mills.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the days after reforms whenpeasants began to independently economy, more and more visible it becamestratification. Consequently, it podilylosya into three main groups:</span></p>

They do notland or have had insufficient to prohoduvatysya. To somehowsurvive, poor men were hired to work for wealthy landowners and villagersor looking for other seasonal work. The reasons for the situation in which they caught weredifferent. Some are not able to farm, someone could not live with their smallinheritance, were sometimes the cause of misery, disease, natural disaster, and sometimes -just laziness and drunkenness. A significant indication of poor growthtensions in post Ukrainian village. This situation was somewhatresult of inconsistent and incomplete land reform in 1861</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Nobility</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Reform of 1861 wasspeech material event for the majority of the nobility. Accustomed to manage uncontrolledthe fate of their peasants and not think about where are moneylandlords found themselves after the reform in unusual circumstances.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For many of these tasks weretoo heavy. Instead of refitting their estates, they buy cars, etc.tried to keep the old way of life. When money is not enough - laidpossessions and took a loan, a little thinking on what will happen next. Because ofof 1877 77% of noblemen had large debts, which are constantly growing.Pay by the habit of relaxing the lives of many had land whichthey bought enterprising farmers. In 1862-1914 he nobility tenurein Dnieper Ukraine decreased by 53%.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yet part of landownersRight Bank and the South managed to rebuild its economy according tonew conditions. In new estates, savings created large commodity productionusing free-labor. In the early 90&#39;s among landownersfarms, estates Naddniprianshchyna savings amounted to 40%. The most famous amongThey had land tycoons of the South: Fein-fold in Taurus, Arkas the Kherson region,Pigeons on Ekaterinoslavschine. Although their social affiliation of new lordsfarms remained the privileged status of nobility, they actuallyaway from the big bourgeoisie. Some of them also went on to become mastersfactories, banks.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Evolution of the nobility Naddniprianshchynaper day after reforms testified that his role ancient imperial elites betrayedinto oblivion.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Workers</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">New social stratumafter reforms became Naddniprianshchyna industrial workers. In the late nineteenth century.number of industrial workers Naddniprianshchyna was 330 thousand souls. Theyaccounted for only 7% of the available labor force, though in general their numbers on agrarian reformyears has increased four times.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Industrial workers, unlikeof farmers had no means of production and therefore had tonot sell their own products, and their workforces.

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Here is a typical picture of the early workday. Darkness are heard in the vicinity of loud factory whistle. This is a Call -to work for workers. Each factory has its whistle, and the workers knowit. Under the first they had to wake up, the second - Exitbarracks, for the third - to be at their jobs.

Normally payments to workerscarried out three to four times a year - at Christmas, Easter and more.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. Cities change their appearance</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Industrialization has caused considerablechanges in urban life. Cities have become, to some extent, a reflection of the changes thatplace in society.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A characteristic phenomenon associated withrapid growth of urban population, is the emergence of lodging houses in almostevery major city. Their inhabitants were mostly farmers who workedin local mills and factories. These new commoners were not adapted to the newhabitats, new values, local traditions and habits. They brokewith its past badly oriented in the present, were not convincedfuture and therefore often found themselves at the limits of life, became publicmarginalized (from Lat. marginalis - whoever is on the edge). Theyto swell the band of urban thieves, beggars and so on. Public bottoms were a massbackground of urban discontent, the source claims the introduction of egalitarianism and immediateradical transformations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A significant percentage ofimmigrants to those of Ukrainian cities, which became important industrialcenters, were peasants from the Russian provinces. Increasing their number incities and the domination of Russian culture were causing that on city streetsdominant Russian language. So, if in Kiev in 1874 Ukrainian language60% believed their native inhabitants, in 1917 - only 16%. Even the mostcontemporary Ukrainian public figures and religious leaders of nationalspeak Russian, because otherwise they could not.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Industrialization changed not onlycomposition of the townspeople, but also the appearance of cities. Particularly intensively changedEkaterinoslav, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, which turned into a bigcommercial and industrial centers. A growing number of stone buildings was reduced.Number of stone in Kiev has grown from 361 in 1856 to 3 thousand in80&#39;s Shall a significant number of public buildings: the county and provincialcounty agencies, city thoughts, noble and provincial assemblies and more.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Significant changes have occurred in the cityimprovement. Central Street taught stones, slabs, bricks. Sidewalkslate nineteenth century. began to cover the asphalt. Increased attention to landscapingcities. Along the streets in Kiev planted linden, poplar, chestnut, Pridneprovskayaslopes are transformed into cozy parks. On the streets of southern cities were plantedacacia. In the second half of the nineteenth century. significantly improved urban lightingstreets. First, they lit kerosene, and later - with gas lamps.Late 70&#39;s gas lighting appeared in Kiev, the capital, and with1890 city began to light up the electricity. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unfolded as buildingwater supply. In 1872 one of the first water supply system was built in Kyiv,provided the city Dnieper water. In subsequent years there were water pipes inOdessa, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Alexander. However, most of the urban population,as before, used a private well. The important problem of urban developmentwas the sewage system. Its primitive in the past caused manyoutbreaks of epidemics of infectious diseases among the urban population. InsideNineteenth century. sewers were built in Feodosia, where the imperial restknow. End of the century was the drainage work in Kiev, Odessa, Yalta.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the early 80&#39;s startedrapid expansion of telephone service. Ten years have phone linesoperated in Odessa, Kiev, Kharkov, Nikolayev. A rather high monthly feenumber of phone users was small.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The growth of cities and increasetheir population has caused the emergence of urban transportation. In citiesany horse railroad - com. In 1890 Konka appeared on the streetsKyiv, and later in other cities. Since the 80&#39;s in major citiesNaddniprianshchyna built power plant.
