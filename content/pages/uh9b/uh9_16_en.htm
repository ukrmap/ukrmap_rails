Causeddevelopment needs as a society and a lack of interference byimperial officials who saw no danger in the work of scientists.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The development of astronomy helpedestablishing astronomical observatories in Kharkov (1808), Nikolaev(1821) and Kiev (1845).

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The national and cultural revival,that began in the late XVIII century Transcarpathia. has become a powerful impetusdisclosure to the talents of Carpatho-Rusyns. While many Ukrainian-Rusynswere able to get an education. So this group is highlyintellectuals who through their skills and hard work have acquired in educationWestern universities. However, opportunities for research activities inMotherland, which was then not a single university, lackedso they had to seek work in foreign lands. Through scientific ability andthorough education of all scientists managed to make significant Transcarpathianscontribution to the development of the country, where he worked. Working in a foreign land, they neverforget their native land and were sort of cultural ambassadors of Transcarpathiafar beyond.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Great merit in establishingContact between young people and talented zakarpatskoy of Western scientistsbelonged to the world <b style="">John Forhashi</b>(1786-1834). After receiving his theological education in Uzhgorod, he moved toVienna, where he became a priest of St.. Barbara. It was added to the groupSlavic people like ideas of national revival. Forhashi workedstudy of the history of Transcarpathia and popular language. However, he contributed their efforts toorganization of education and scientific and educational work in the European Transcarpathianscountries. With his request, for example, received an invitation to work in Italyscholar, linguist, historian M. Luchkaya.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Research Transcarpathians JohnZemanchyka, a distinguished physicist and mathematician, was associated with Lviv andKrakow University. He was a professor, dean and rector of Lvivuniversity institute in Ruska taught at the University of vernacularUkrainian students, physics and mathematics.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Many scientists have gone Transcarpathianswork to the Russian Empire. John came here first eagle. In the RussianEagle Empire held high positions, many made for improvingmedical education. When there began to reform the education system and seek teachersto work in the newly established educational institutions, an eagle advised to invite youngTranscarpathian scientists.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The invitation to work in the RussianEmpire received three Subcarpathian Professors: <b style="">Michael Baludyanskyy</b> (1769–1847), <b style="">Peter</b> <b style="">Lodi</b> (1764–1829),

As a result, these peopleEuropean culture have come in conflict with the imperial reality. But this is notbelittle the importance of Transcarpathian scientists for spreading Europeanideas in Russia.</span></p>
