<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On the Left Bank, where begannational revival in bank Ukraine, this role was responsibleCossack officers.

Much of the Cossack beganexpress protests. The reason for their opposition was fear of losing oldrights and privileges. Unlike the Russian nobility, the Ukrainian nobility wasexempt from compulsory military service and state. Their estates are notsubject to civil forfeiture and could only judge them the same nobles, asthey. However, protecting their class privileges, the Cossack elite objectivelyassisted the struggle for the restoration of autonomy Free University. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fervent protest against oppressionHomeland Empire was an act come from Poltava <b style="">Basil Kapnist</b> (1758-1823), who in 1782 defiantlyleft public service to high office in St. Petersburg and returned to Ukraine.That year there was well-known &quot;Ode to slavery, where he lamented the situation,being faced by Ukraine.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Ukrainian National Homerevival of the Left</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The impetus for nationalrevival of the Left has been to increase interest in the history of Ukraine.It was connected with the necessity of Cossack descendants potverdzhuvaty theirclaims to the Russian nobility historical documents.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first the imperial government recognizedthat any former Ukrainian military and civil service entitlesnobility.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ukrainian nobles were indignantlodge appeals directly to the emperor, substantiating theirclaim documents from family archives - letters of Polish kings andLithuanian princes, agreements with Moscow Ukrainian Hetman kings. Onthis ground in the Dnieper movement emerged, which led the nobles-autonomists.Ukrainian patriots A. Chepa, V. Poletyka, R. Markovic, M. Miloradovich, T. Kalyns&#39;kyi,V. Chernish did not need to look for evidence of domestic origin, but &quot;by and userdiyulove for the nation &quot;willingly assisted in the others. &quot;How nice - wroteVasily Poletyka - work for the glory of the homeland and the goodness! Our own feeling,consciousness that we were indifferent to the affairs of the homeland, we are awarded.Success will see new people with the same enthusiasm protect rightsfreedom and freedom of their motherland.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The struggle for recognition of rights tonobility existed until 1835 While many of those about himcare, have not desired, this movement had a profound effect.

The exact datecreation and its author remains unknown. Written on it was probably onNovgorod-Siversky. Found the manuscript &quot;History Rusov&quot; 1828 in onefamily archives in Chernihiv.

Especially celebrated romance Slavic peoples, predicting themgreat future as a result of their national and cultural awakening.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. Ukrainian national revival inSlobozhanschine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ukrainian National Homerevival in Slobozhanschyna associated with the opening in 1805 KharkivUniversity.

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Moreover, UkrainianLomonosov, &quot;as contemporaries called Karazin was a remarkable scientist and inventor.He is the author of the design of social and economic reforms in the Russian Empirewhich included a restructuring of its constitutional monarchy and the abolition of serfdom.He has repeatedly criticized the humiliating situation when Ukraine was forced toexport commodity, and got out of it produced products.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Of the imperial bureaucracy wasa lot of enemies idea of a university in the Ukrainian lands, and achieveimplementation of the idea Karasin managed only by the support of wide sectionspopulation. Nobles, commoners, merchants Sloboda-Ukrainian and other provincescollected the necessary funds, and descendants of Cossacks simple - the military man in the streetgave almost nothing to build university buildings 125 acres of land. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Teach in KharkivKarasin University invited the most famous European scientists.

Although in theory the Freemasons proclaim their non-interference inpolitical life, in fact, from the XVIII century. they played an importantrole in the revolutionary events and national liberation movements.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Because the Masonic movement wasattended mainly by representatives of the social elite, the center of their activities wereCities, towns and the landlords&#39; estates.

However, when rumors of even this relativelylimited activity reached the imperial capital, Alexander and specialResolution 1819 banned its activities.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next step, which indicateddeepening of Ukrainian orientation of Freemasonry, was the establishment in the firsthalf of the 20-ies Nineteenth century. the Left Bank &quot;Little Russian secretCompanies.
