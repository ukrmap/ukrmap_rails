<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sad inheritance from previoustime was that the Ukrainian elite in this region actually existed. Apparently,Because of this, the Austrian government initially believed that inhabit Polish Galicia, Transcarpathia -Hungarians, and Bukovina - Romania. It was only later realized the Habsburgs, the vastthe population of these lands - Ukrainian, but they do not have aelite. Then, by the usual imperial principle of &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, the Habsburgsbegan to enlist the ruling Polish, Hungarian and Romanian circle withto strengthen position in the land. Their status for the language gradually became the secondby value (after German) at Western.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Impact of reforms on the development of HabsburgWestern Ukraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the history of the Habsburg70-80&#39;s XVIII century. included as a era of reform EmpressMaria Theresa and her son Joseph II. These reforms in the spirit of enlightened policyabsolutism carried out throughout the empire, but they are particularly significant impacthad at Western. The purpose of reform here was:</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">improvementfinancial situation of the population, as this objective the stabilization ofsocio-economic situation of the land and thus - to strengthen the empire;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">eliminationthe old system of government under which belonged to the local dominantnobility. and replace it with disciplined, which led a policy of the empire wouldCenter officials.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Reforms were distributed mainly inadministration, relations in agriculture, education and church life.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the administrative field duringJoseph II the entire province - Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria peredilylyto individual districts (with a separate county in 1786 was Bukovina). Action allPolish laws of 1786 stopped, their zastupaly to general.Thus, administrative reforms have caused a decline in power of Polesin the province and its concentration in the imperial officials.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Significant changes have occurred in the agriculturalarea. By order of Maria Theresa in the linked states were derived&quot;Inventory&quot;, which recorded the number of land owned by the nobility, anddefined duties peasants. This imperial government could not really imaginethe taxes on these lands, while demand from landlords that theypeasants did not have more than the &quot;Inventariyem. Also limitedphysical punishment, prohibited boon to Sunday and holidays, forcedwithout the consent of farmers and others.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Emperor Joseph II for1780-1782 biennium has issued several laws under which farmers were exempted frompersonal dependence, and clearly stated the size of serfdom (not more than three daysper week). However, farmers were provided minimal social rights -marry without the permission of the landowner, to send their children to learnurban schools; likviduvalosya law judge Mr peasants and more. Peasant communitieswere also given the right government. In 1789 emperor passed a law onelimination of serfdom, but after his death, the law abolished, but all otherchanges there.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Church lifeWestern Ukraine has also become a sphere, where a significant change. Constantpetition the Greek Catholic clergy of Galicia and Transcarpathia to Viennagovernment for protection from harassment by local Catholics Rusyn-Ukrainian and recognitiontheir distinct people had a good effect. Maria Theresa forbade useGreek Catholics on the phrase &quot;Uniates&quot; and acknowledged that the Roman Catholic andGreek Catholic Church in Western Ukraine have absolutely equallaw. Roman Catholics were strictly forbidden to force the Greek-Catholicschange faith. Emperor Joseph II in 1781 passed a law in accordance withwhich all Christian churches in his possession got equal rights. Non-Catholicsnow gained equal rights with Catholics in public service. Partreligious reform became emperor in equalizing the rights of other nations of the Jews(Note that in the Russian Empire, the Pale of Settlement and other restrictionsexisted until 1917). The net effect of these reforms forGreek Catholic Church - the only organization with which ototozhnyuvalosyaUkrainian religious life in Galicia and Transcarpathia became significantly increasing itsposition.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">With changes in church life wereRelated changes also in education, which then adhere to the church.To enable the Greek Catholic clergy to gain higher spiritualeducation initiative of Maria Theresa in Vienna in 1774 at the Church of St.Barbara opened a general Greek Catholic seminary (Barbareum). Induring the reign of Joseph II &quot;Barbareum was closed, but instead createdseminary directly at Western - and in LvivUzhgorod. They also recovered (from 1784), the LvivUniversity. In his four faculties enrolled 250 students. Aslectures were read in Latin and German, for Rusyn-Ukrainian atUniversity was established &quot;Studium rutenium&quot; (Ruses Institute), where sciencetaught Church Slavonic. &quot;Ruses Institute existed for1787-1809 biennium</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Far-reaching consequences forUkrainian population of the area had a school reform Maria Theresa, held1777, which in elementary (primary) schools of teaching nativeparent language.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thus, reforms of Maria Theresa andJoseph II contributed to the political modernization of the Western lands, but notenvisage measures to change the economic situation. Yet they contributedspread among the peasants and the Greek Catholic clergy of this land salutaryattitude to the Habsburgs. It is through this they gained fame faithful Empire&quot;Tiroltsiv East.</span></p>
