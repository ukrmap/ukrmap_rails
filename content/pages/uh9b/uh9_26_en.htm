<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Limited and inconsistentReform 60&#39;s caused the growth of different layers of discontentsociety. Young people tend to maximalism, became the basis for the radical movement,who advocated the acceleration of dramatic change. Radical youthEmpire, which at</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">’</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">yednuvalas in a secret organization toagainst the existing order, called populists. This name was derived fromidealization of the young people of different ranks of intellectuals (in RussianEmpire - the peasantry). Populists, adopting the ideology of their predecessorsA. Herzen, M. Chernyshevsky of peasant socialism on the path of uncompromisinganti-tsarist.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Populism - adifferent ranks of the intelligentsia-wide movement, which arose under the influence ofSocialism and the features of Russia in the second half of the XIX century. Theyadvocated the overthrow of the autocracy through peasant revolution. Appearinglate 60&#39;s XIX century., The populist movement became a significant factorsocial and political life in the mid 70&#39;s Narodniks were convincedthat collectivist traditions of rural communities is the foundation of the socialistorganization of society. Russia, they are interpreted, unlike WesternEurope must avoid a capitalist stage of development and farmers populistsconsidered the driving force behind the revolution in the way of society to socialism.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In General-motionpopulists took an active part and radical Ukrainian youngstersdid not satisfy the cultural boundaries of the Ukrainian movement.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first circle was populistsorganized in 1871 in St. Petersburg Michael Czajkowski. Subsequentlysimilar groups emerged in many cities of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Populism in Ukraine developedalmost the same as in the whole Russian Empire, having, however, some features.Here it is, despite its social direction, had to take account of the Ukrainian Nationalmovement, Ukrainian national characteristics, their history. In addition toUkrainian peasant village community did not play such a role as centralareas of Russia, and Ukrainian peasants were developed sense of ownership. Itimmediately included in contrast with the main idea of populism, the natural inclinationpeasants to socialism.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first circle likeSt. Petersburg, appeared in Kiev in 1872 (P. Axelrod, G. Gurevich,S. Lurie et al.). In 1873 in the city was one of the largestRussian Empire under the leadership circle F. Bolkhovsky. Among its 115Members were such prominent figures in the future of the populist movement, as Andrew ZhelyabovAndrew Frandzhali, S. Chudnovsky, V. Kostyurin et al.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Deployment of the populist movementhas caused controversy regarding the most effective way of achieving this goal.One of the areas associated with the famous Russian populists Peter Lavrov, defendedgradual approach to preparing people for the revolution through education andpropaganda. Another approach was associated with the figure known not only in Russia butMikhail Bakunin in Europe. He was the founder of a revolutionary new direction inmovement - anarchism, which denied the need for government and other politicalpower, preached unlimited individual liberty. Supporters of anarchism (Bakuninism</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">m) believed that people in poverty who are always readythe rebellion (rebellion). You just need to raise a rebellion, which develop intorevolution. He argued that for the revolution can be usedany means: &quot;A knife, poison, noose - a revolution is equally justified.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Ukraine, the most activeBakuninists circle was &quot;Kiev commune. She united to 80 personsmostly students. Such its members as Faith Zasulich, Vladimir Debahoriy-MokriyevychStefanovic and James, later became prominent revolutionary populists.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the two areasthere was a third, which was the ideologue P. Tkachev. He believed that the RussianEmpire either propaganda or appeal to people&#39;s revolt does not give effect. In hisopinion, the only way to change society was a revolutionary conspiracy, namely:small group of conspirators, through the coup, had to takepower, and then make the necessary socialist transformation.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. &quot;Walking in the nation.&quot; Chygyryns&#39;ka conspiracy</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1874 About 3 thousandpopulists &quot;went to the people.&quot; They launched a propaganda work amongpeasants. Throwing their university studies, disguised in peasant clothing,populists took the village of revolutionary socialist ideas. However, this &quot;walking inpeople &quot;were defeated. Not all participants &quot;walking&quot; suffered repression bygovernment. The peasants simply refused to deal with foreigners from the city, and ofteneven helped identify gendarmes revolutionaries. Where luckyestablishing contact, the villagers have heard that directly touched theirneeds, but the talk of socialism in general do not understand. Villagers believed&quot;Good&quot; king who satisfy the aspirations of the peasants of equitable distributionland and punish offenders (landlords and bureaucrats).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The failure of &quot;people walking in&quot; forcedpopulists seek new ways to fight.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of them was to unifyrevolutionary populists in a single organization, which was coordinated anddirect the activities of all revolutionary forces. Spring 1876 inSt. Petersburg was founded undercover revolutionary organization &quot;Earth andfreedom &quot;. At various times, included her more than 60 active members, among them werecome from Ukraine: son Joseph Aptekman Pavlogradskogo merchant, son Tulchinskogomerchant Lev Deich, son of a military physician from Poltava Sergei Kravchynskyy,descendant of the ancient family from Chernigov Hetman Dmytro Lyzogub et al. Inthe &quot;Earth and will&quot; stressed the need to create&quot;National-revolutionary&quot;. To do this, planned to deploy a wideagitation among the population, cause a protest against authorities&#39; actions and organizearmed rebellion. Go to the new society was to take place through the transfer of landfarmers, public land ownership and secular government. And grabassumed power in the shortest time through a violent coup.<b style=""><i style=""><span style="color: red;"> </span></i></b></span></p>

With the help of Deutsch and he rigged Bohanovskoho&quot;Imperial secret charter&quot; which was written that the king knows about the plight ofhis subjects, but was prevented landowners. So farmers have to take care of themselveshimself: the landlords and fairly clear divide all the land. And for this theyshould unite in a &quot;secret wife&quot;. Statute of underground peasantorganizations also have been developed.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Having lost faith in the peasantryable to rise against autocracy, populists reviewed tactics and combatresorted to terror. V.

In the fight against populists werethrow all the police forces. During the 1878-1879 biennium Police crushedmajor groups and groups and gave the court their participants.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite repression, radicalminded populists sought to intensify terrorist activity. But not allshared those views.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In August 1879 &quot;Earth andWill &quot;split into separate organizations - the People&#39;s will&quot; and &quot;Black Division.&quot;People&#39;s Will&quot; opened a new phase of the revolutionary movement, the revolutionary stageterror.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thus, neither a terrorist noradvocacy populists not reached the goal. Amongleaders of the movement was published errors awareness of their views and beliefs.Make a socialist revolution based on the peasantry, it was not possible.</span></p>
