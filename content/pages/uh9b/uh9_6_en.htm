The shift in Western Europeinfluenced the economic development of Ukraine Dnieper. During the firsthalf of the nineteenth century. on these grounds the process of gaining new strengthmarket economy and the decline of serfdom. However, he performed in difficultconditions under various, sometimes contradictory factors. The big difference wasdevelopment in different regions of the Ukrainian lands.

GraduallySouth vtyahuvav the orbit of market relations and not only the Right Bank Left BankUkraine and other regions of the empire, where old feudal relations rule.In the opposite direction completely developed at this time agricultureRight Bank, where the dominant forced labor of peasants-serfs. SituationUkrainian peasants, serfs in some farms plantations resembled the Right Bankslavery in the southern United States. The situation when the market economy coexisted withfree &quot;labor and forced labor, as evidenced by U.S. experience, couldpersist long enough. Only transformation of forced labor on an obstacle forfurther industrialization and a resulting slowdown in economicdevelopment forced the ruling elite to resort to reform outdatedindustrial relations.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Development of agriculture</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The basis of the economy DnieperUkraine in the first half of the nineteenth century. was agriculture, whichhad about 95% at the beginning and 89% of the population in the Middle Ages. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the first half of the nineteenth century. onUkrainian lands dominated private landlordism, which tookabout 75% of the land. However, the size of the land holdings were different: theRight Ukraine dominated large farm, in Left Bank andSouthern Ukraine - small estates. Main manufactureragricultural products to farmers, which was divided into two mainGroups:</span></p>

They were personally free. The role of the landowner for thecategory of farmers has played the State to whom they hadservage pay, or when their estates together with government leased(This form of exploitation of farmers existed on the Right Bank).

Prevailing form of exploitation of the landlordspeasant farmers and government on the Right Bank in the first half of the nineteenth century. wasboon. Although the law in 1797 formally limited its 3 days a week,real life she reached 4-6 days. The landowners avoided the law bysystem of regular school activities, when serfdom was given one day such a task (&quot;class&quot;), whichit is possible there was a two to three days.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And farmers suffered fromshortage of arable land. Due to increased demand for agricultural products,increasing the number of landed estates meant for larger estates holderprofits, so the size of peasant holdings continuously decreased.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The spread of serfdom and obezzemelennyapeasants were concerned with acquiring landowner economy tradecharacter. Tovaryzatsiya production in the feudal system led to increasednon-economic methods of regulation of production (labor without interestemployee) and securing the extensive development of the economy (through involvementadditional resources - land and workers).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Strengthening exploitation of peasantslandlords allegedly achieved their goal and increased their own profits. But at the same timeimpoverishment of the major manufacturers and the decline of their economies, lack ofpeasant serfs better incentives to work, inability to use the newequipment made economic prosperity and landowners estates briefbrought closer to their inevitable decline. Finally, after a brief period of prosperity in30-40-ies feudal economy found itself in the face of crisis. Therewhich used &quot;free labor, the situation was opposite. Economicregulation of production methods (employee interest in the results of itslabor) made it possible to intensive farming methods (developmentmanagement without additional resources by improving laborPeasants and quality of work performed).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Some examples of diffusion of newmanagement methods were the Left, but they became the largest distributionin southern Ukraine. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the first halfNineteenth century. in the production process tovaryzatsiyi were drawn and farming,resulted in the stratification of peasants. However, the existence panschynnohoeconomy kept the process. Rapidly bundle wasamong state peasants and the Left Bank of the South. Farmers-owners in Ekaterinoslavskoyprovince concentrated in the hands of 18% private land. Some appearwealthy farmers who owned or rented 100 and more acres of land. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The process of separation took placelandowners among the peasants. They were allowed to buy land in the name of his landlord,establish an enterprise with agricultural products processing, usefree &quot;labor. However, their legal status remained unchanged, andlandowner could ever take away all their property.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial; letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">3. Developmentindustry. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first half of the nineteenth century. wasqualitative changes in the era of industrial development Dnieper Ukraineconcerned with the industrial revolution, which began on these landsin the 30&#39;s The main contents of the Industrial Revolution was the transition fromfactory to factory. Manufactory of Ukrainian lands within the RussianEmpire were companies based on forced labor of serfs. Sotransition to factory industry, which was based on free-Labour was also the processes of destruction and feudal serfdom relations. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In addition to qualitative occurred andquantitative change: 1825 Dnieper in Ukraine there were about 650industrial enterprises, 1861 it was already 2330. At the beginning of the centurymanufactory founded that landlords who have had this for money,workers, peasants who worked on them for free.

Because the number of companies that used free-work has increased: in 1825 they worked 25% of workers, and1861 - almost 74%.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Particularly rapid process occurredIndustrial Revolution and the conversion of the free-laborcloth industry. Since 1805 to 1859 number of woolenenterprises increased from 27 to 160, while in the landlords at the time there were onlyAbout 30 enterprises. The main center of the cloth industry NaddniprianshchynaKlyntsi village was in Chernihiv, where in 1860 there were already 9 cloth factory.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first cars for new businessesimported from abroad, mainly through the port of Odessa.

In 1861Dnieper in Ukraine there were at least 20 mechanical plants and manymechanical workshops.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since the formation of plantindustry was the emergence of new social classes: businessmen andindustrial workers.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The process of staffindustrial workers was slow pace, since it preventedthe existence of serfdom. The sources of its formation were improvised state peasants,devastated urban artisans, rural home workers and released on servage landlordsfarmers (some of their earnings in the factory as they gave money servagelandowner). The situation of most workers was very difficult. Daysometimes reached 15 hours, wages were meager, and the conditions of life - juststaggering.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the suppression of the PolishUprising 1830-1831 biennium on the right bank of Ukraine was carried outforfeiture to the state in the estates of landowners who participated inrebellion. The fortress of these estates was transferred to the state government peasants. Nowthese public estates with peasants leased. But the activitytenants only aggravated exploitation of peasants.

By agreeing to &quot;inventory rule, both parties havecould not change them. In these very moderate, and those that did not solve the problemabolition of serfdom major initiatives was that serfdom finallyvvodylosya at least some in the legal field. Serfs are not considered as livingtools, and became a legal party, one of the parties to the transaction.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Introducing &quot;Inventory rules&quot;caused resentment of landowners, who saw in them too much government intervention intheir cases. Numerous violations of these rules led to new peasant performances.Generally, however, the situation has not threatened the stability of imperial power.
