<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Socio-economic life in Europe</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art.Europeans living environment has undergone significant changes. Previously most of the populationEuropean countries lived in rural areas, where concentrated economiclife. In the modern era began the process of urbanization (from Lat. <span class="SpellE">urbanus</span>- City) - concentration of population andeconomic life in big cities. The main reasons for increasing theUrbanization in Europe were:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">appearance of largenumber of peasants who could not find work in the village and had to look it upcities;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">small declinetrade, handicraft production and, consequently, cause the disappearance of smallcities with a population of 10-15 thousand souls.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Became a symbol of a new era of migration(From Lat. <span class="SpellE">migratio</span>- Relocation) -mass displacement of people associated with the change of residence.Simultaneously with the immigration in large cities land spread emigration (from Lat. <span class="SpellE">emigratio</span>- Check-out &quot;) - forced orvoluntary resettlement of people from their country to another for economic,political or religious reasons, and immigration (from Lat. <span class="SpellE">immigratio</span>-settling) - entry of foreigners into the country on long-term or permanent residence.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Deploying migrationevidence of changes in the perception of most people. Now, they were insearch of better living conditions are no longer afraid to leave their usual place and seekhappiness in a foreign land.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Changes in the structure of the population,associated with becoming an industrial society, caused an increasedemand for food. This, in turn, caused the phenomenon, it is calledagricultural revolution. Still, the pace and extent of these changes were significantlyless than that of industrial production. In the village appeared Steam reaper,thresher, mower, etc.. This technique facilitated the work of a peasant, and at the same timeled to the emergence of excess labor. For <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art.number of people engaged in agriculture, constantlydecreased.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By the middle <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art.feudal relationships that non-economic means &quot;tied&quot; to the peasantland and forced it to work, missing virtually all of Western Europe.European peasants worked the land to meet their own needs,paying any taxes determined state. In the Russian Empirefeudal and feudal relations in 1861 kept</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Progress in agricultural developmentwas associated with the deployment of the Industrial Revolution, and laterindustrialization. Agriculture has provided new industrialEnterprise workforce due to its abundance, and at the same time was a consumer marketindustrial products. Industrial revolution unfolding in Europe from the westcontinent to the east. It was initiated, as you already know, 60&#39;s <span class="SpellE">XVIII</span>Art. in England. Spread over the continent on the brink30-40-ies she reached the Austrian and Russian empires, to thewhich at that time consisted of Ukrainian lands. The net effect of industrialRevolution was the replacement of agricultural society to industrial. Processesdeployed in agriculture and industry, led to significant changesin the social structure of European countries. Has quite a large averageclass - the bourgeoisie, officials and intellectuals. Often these people have goodeducation, work, and was the basis of social stability. At the same timemiddle class were industrial workers, living conditions most of whichat first were very severe.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Ideological and political currents of a new era</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Industrial Revolution dramaticallyinfluenced public life, had led to a whole new wave of theoriesopinions and movements. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For ideological quest beginning <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art. were characterized by attempts to understand and assimilatelessons of the French Revolution end <span class="SpellE">XVIII</span>c. ..Disillusionment with the ideals of the Enlightenment, when in the name of freedom, equality andfraternity originally been established bloody Jacobin dictatorship, and later EmpireNapoleon, led to the formation of new ideological and political trends:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">liberalism -united supporters of the parliamentary system, freedom of establishmentcivil and political rights and freedoms of individuals. At first put forwardneeds of individuals who were considered more important than the interests of the collective;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">conservatism -reflected the political views of those who advocated the preservation of traditional valuesand the foundations of social life, and the need to implement radical changes in lifesociety categorically denied bending to progressive transformation;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">radicalism -united supporters of radical changes in society, radicalmeasures and extreme views. Make this they demanded immediately.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The debate between advocates of theseviews, in one form or the form was part of the politicalday life of European countries becoming industrialized society.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. &quot;The era of nationalism&quot;</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Along with detailed abovehas another current, which proponents believe the priority factorsocial development life of the nation. Based on these views emerged nationalismwhich became, according to some scholars, one of the most influential and <span class="SpellE">most sustainable</span> ideas of human history. Nationalism wasupstream, which proponents believe the nation one of the largest values consideredthat it should be free and live his own political life, with autonomyor an independent country. Right, in their opinion, was one of the essential,natural rights.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Start spreading these views inEurope marked the end of the French Revolution <span class="SpellE">XVIII</span>Art.,which replaced memorized call &quot;Long live the king!&quot; new, coming from the heart andheart: &quot;Long live the nation!&quot;. This event has finished <span class="SpellE">donatsionalnu</span>era in human history and launched a new era of national existence.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was during the revolution into the arenapolitical life has a new entity, a nation that in the struggle for &quot;a place undersun &quot;have adopted the national idea. During the Revolution appeared thatwas named humane or <span class="SpellE">revival</span>. In thisa nationalism not mean anything other than love for the nation,readiness for any sacrifice for the sake of its existence and prosperity. His rolewas limited exclusively to the formation of nations, the formation of national states andtheir protection. Nationalism preached the equality of peoples, respect for theirrights and freedoms, demonstrating tolerance to other nationalism.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">French Revolution, andtoo - Napoleonic wars caused a wave of rising nationalism ornational liberation struggle virtually all European nationsespecially among those who attacked the French army. Thenfinally vykrystalizuvavsya nationality principle by which every nation isbearer of supreme power and has the right to establish their own national state.Since then, this principle was one of the major components of the national idea.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Further development of ideas <span class="SpellE">revival</span> nationalism was associated with activityGerman philosophers. As a result of the defeat of Prussia in the war against Napoleon philosopher <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Johann Gottlieb</b></span><b style=""> <span class="SpellE">Fichte</span></b>(1762-1814) called on Germans to national revival. Germans Hopeunite in one state after the Congress of Vienna (1815) werefailure. This resulted in the deployment of German lands romantic youthmovement. His goal was national unification and the formation of the German state.The theoretical basis of this movement was <b style="">romanticism</b>-direction of the spiritual culture of the first half <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art.,who supported the desire of man to freedom, her desire to cultivate,maintained a large value of national traditions and language.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the theorists of Romanticism,German philosopher <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Johann Gottfried</b></span><b style=""> <span class="SpellE">Herder</span> </b>(1744-1803)special attention paid to the Slavic peoples, predicting a great future for them.Especially vyriznyav it from other Ukrainian people. &quot;<span class="SpellE">Ukraine -</span>asserted <span class="SpellE">philosopher -</span> will once the new Greece. Perfectpidsonnya this country, people, sweet temper, his musical talent, fertile landoburyatsya once. From the small tribes that were once the Greeks face the greatcultural nation. Its boundaries prostyahnutsya to the Black Sea and from there into the wideworld &quot;. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Spreading the ideas of nationalism inEastern Europe, including Ukraine, largely contributed to the Poles. Because ofPartitions of Poland, they lost their state at the moment thatconsidered a time of birth of nationalism.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Desperate battle for Polesrestore the lost state had a significant influence on young intellectuals <span class="SpellE">Central</span> and Eastern European nations, among which were theUkrainian, which at that time also experienced a period of national awakening.The activity of Polish patriots them was the example model, theyused in view of their historical context.</span></p>

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Excerpts from works by Jean-JacquesRousseau&#39;s &quot;Reflections on the Government of Poland&quot;</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;You [poles] can not prevent[Your enemies] swallow you, but if you comply with order to nonePole never became a Russian, I guarantee: Russia can not serve, Poland.</span></p>

<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consider: 1</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Under what conditionsnation can survive under the imperial domination? <b style="">2.</b> What was supposed to make the Ukrainian elite, to protect Ukrainiandenationalization of the power of two empires?</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, the Polish national movementwas very limited in the social and the national levels. Inlong time the Poles did not serve to improve the status of serfpeasants, demanded restoration of Poland is not settling within the ethnic Polishpeople, and within the borders of the Commonwealth. This feature is defined, in particular,at least indifference (and sometimes hostility) Ukrainian to fight the Poles.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">National awakening of stateless peoples became part ofEuropean social and political life <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> One of the European national movements of the oppressedpeople stood and Ukrainian.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. What is the National Recovery?</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The term &quot;national revival&quot;became an ideological invention <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art. contemporaryintelligent <span class="SpellE">elites</span> (Elite - top layer)people who fought for the creation of a new state. Its formationcontained the idea that in the historical past, there was a nation that resultunfavorable historical conditions declined and now aims to be reborn.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first example ofthe term &quot;revival&quot; to the Italian national enthusiasm wasnational movement. In 1847 Piedmont came out in the magazine &quot;Renaissance&quot;, byand what were called this movement. Subsequently, the term &quot;national revival&quot; ormatch - the awakening of nations &quot;came to characterize the distribution of othernational movements.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But the real meaning of thisconcept in the modern era was somewhat different. <b style="">Bycontent and form of national revival removed form the creation of new nations assubjects of modern European history.</b> National revival in modernand every day as complicated and lengthy historical process in time, you canredistribute into several stages.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Czech scientist <b style="">Miroslav <span class="SpellE">Soviet Writer</span></b>,researcher of the history of national movements of the Slavic nations, offered threeconventional stages, namely:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><i style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">folklore-ethnographic,</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial;"> when some researchers enthusiasts &quot;invent&quot;nationality, collected and published folk songs, history, customs,language of his people. As a result, they find the arguments to provethe idea that some ethnographic group is a separate community from the perspective of ethnography, philologyand history;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><i style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">cultural,</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial;"> literary or when research undertaken at the first stage,translated into specific ideas that spread among the educated classes. MainLanguage revival is the struggle for expansion of its use;</span></p>

Having political organizationscreated political programs to the requirements of obtaining government, autonomyand, eventually, independence.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In real life these peopleperehreschuvalysya stage often - sometimes within the second emergingelements of the third or there were signs of the first stage. Comply with this scheme andprocesses of the Ukrainian <span class="SpellE">sense formation of nation</span> in the modern day.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. The intelligentsia and spread of new ideas</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Important role in bringing newideas <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art. played a new social group,that in Western European countries called intellectuals, andEast - the intellectuals. In a broader sense, this conceptunited representatives of various groups who had higher education. However, the mainfeature characteristic of intellectuals, was that it united peoplededicate themselves to serving the people, the struggle for improvement of its cultural,social and political situation.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The emergence of intellectuals had importantimportance for further development of European nations. Especially important wasfor such societies, as Ukrainian, as a result of imperial acquisitionsstructures lost its old national elites. Intelligentsia hiding itwas a new cultural and political elite of society in the modern day.</span></p>
