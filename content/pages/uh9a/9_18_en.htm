Despite the difficulties, the culture was enriched by remarkable achievements in all major industries.</p><p class="rvps2"> <a name=RichViewCheckpoint0> </a> In the early twentieth century. in the cultural sphere vymalovuyutsya clearly two trends - preserving national cultural identity (populism) and transplantation on Ukrainian soil samples of the newest European artistic self-expression (modernism). Synteznoyu characteristic model of populism and modernism has become the &quot;new school&quot; of Ukrainian prose (Kotsyubyns&#39;kyi V. Stefanik, A. Kobylyanskaya, M. Cheremshina), which in his work organically combine traditional etnohrafizm national literature, the story first-person et al. with the latest European achievements - and psyhoanalizmom symbolism.</p><p class="rvps2"> Ukrainian literature first modernist slogans put forward in 1901 the poet M. Blackie, who on the &#39;Literary and Scientific Bulletin &quot;on the software open letter called back to the idea of&quot; real sweet poetry &quot;, content and genre enhance existing in literature of the time frame. Relay M. Voronoi adopted Galician writers group &quot;Young muse&quot; (P. Karmansky, V. Pachkovskyy, A. Lutsky et al.), Which in 1907 published its manifesto, which contained criticisms of realism in literature and focusing on common European patterns and trends.</p><p class="rvps2"> late nineteenth century. - In the early twentieth century. Nouveau becoming more common in the Ukrainian architecture, which found its expression in geometrically precise lines of buildings, their dynamic form. This style is built railway station in Lviv, Kyiv, Zhmerinka, Kharkiv, Ukraine&#39;s first covered market (Bessarabsky). The brightest figures of architectural modernism were V. Zhukov, O. Verbitsky, M. Verovkin et al. Search and experiments architects-modernists sought to maximize the functionality of buildings, while retaining clarity in the lines of the facade.</p><p class="rvps2"> Ukrainian sculpture early twentieth century. also did not avoid modernist beginnings. Under the influence of Western art schools formed a whole galaxy of Ukrainian sculptors-modernists - Gavrilko M., M. Parashchuk, V. Ischenko, P. Viytovych et al. Their creativity inherent contrast svitlotinovi effects and deep psychologism A. Archipenko enriched the language of twentieth century sculpture.: He made an empty space to be organic and very expressive element composition. Hand of the master are &quot;treading woman, woman who zachisuyetsya&quot; and other works.</p><p class="rvps2"> supporters in painting modernist experimenters were M. Zuk, A. Nowakowski, W. and F. Krychevskys and others.</p><p class="rvps2"> should be stressed that the Ukrainian version of modernism was quite original and has its own peculiarities. By virtue of the fact that the Ukrainian lands had their own state, had been separated and were actually in the status of provinces, social development, they have slow compared with the leading European countries, and hence conflicts between civilizations and cultures, the artist and society were not as sharp . These factors are identified and obscure, poorly expressed, immature nature of the Ukrainian modernism. Private World-ups only vidtinyaly general provincialism and deep traditional Ukrainian culture.</p><p class="rvps2"> Ukrainian modernism not emerged as a national original current, and was detected only in the work of different artists. This style, especially in literature, Romanticism has undergone a significant impact, because of how tradition and mentality of the Ukrainian people, to which romanticism is an organic element in the outlook any day. The originality of the Ukrainian version of modernism lies in the fact that he was of the aesthetic phenomenon into a cultural-historical phenomenon, was an attempt to overcome provintsiynosti, druhoryadnosti, secondariness Ukrainian national culture, a form of attraction to mankind. It seems symbolized the transition of Ukrainian society from ethnographic consumer self-identification, ie the discrimination of self from others, to national self - determination of its place and role in the modern world.</p>
