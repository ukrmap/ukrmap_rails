The state of farms and nature of economic relations at Western </h2><p class="rvps2"> West-land in terms of their economic development is much inferior to other regions of the Habsburg Empire. The basis of the regional economy was agriculture. In Eastern Galicia dominated agriculture. During the first half of the nineteenth century. obezzemelennya increased in the land of peasants. During this time the average size of peasant holdings decreased from 6 to 4 hectares of land holdings and landlords increased from 400 to 600 ha. Field crop cultivation was extensive character, and therefore - low yields. Under such conditions, natural disasters and crop failures caused famine in the countryside in 1805, 1817, 1829, 1844-1847 gg Thus in the same years of grain landowners estates taken out to other provinces of the empire and abroad.</p><p class="rvps2"></p><p class="rvps2"> <b> landlordism at Western in the first half of the nineteenth century. </b></p><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=-1 style="border-width: 0px; border-collapse: collapse;"><tr valign=top><td width=191 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> Region</p> </td><td width=431 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2">%. landlords who owned the land from all</p> </td> </tr><tr valign=top><td width=191 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> Eastern Galicia</p> </td><td width=431 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> 1996</p> </td> </tr><tr valign=top><td width=191 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> Northern Bukovina</p> </td><td width=431 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> 1969</p> </td> </tr><tr valign=top><td width=191 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> Transcarpathia</p> </td><td width=431 valign=top style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;"><p class="rvps2"> 1990</p> </td> </tr> </table><p class="rvps2"></p><p class="rvps2"> In Transcarpathia the most arable land used for industrial viticulture, horticulture and agriculture.

This made the villagers go to work for other parts of the empire. The farm land in mountain areas important role played by farming and logging. Transcarpathian wool and wood came from there for the Hungarian and Austrian markets. The peasantry suffered from bezzemellya, and about half of it had no land. Most of the farmers constantly starving. Almost every year thousands of peasants died of starvation.</p><p class="rvps2"> In most parts of Northern Bukovina leading role in the economy played agriculture, and in mountainous areas - farming, logging and hunting. Actual masters in the land were large landowners, who owned two-thirds majority of farmland and villages.</p><p class="rvps2"> vast majority of peasants were serfs of the Western and was in very serious condition. Boon instead of 2-3 days set by the end of XVIII century. reforms of Maria Theresa and Joseph II, reached 6 days a week. In addition, there were a tribute to nature, duties in favor of the landowner (summer helper days, night watchman, Toloka etc.) and state (roads, bridges, 14-year military service, land tax).</p><p class="rvps2"> Industry of Western Ukraine has been under prolonged stagnation. Traditional sectors of local industry - leather, salt, textiles, timber, tobacco, of iron - almost not evolved. Industry craft kept manufactury-level.

However, the pace of its development upovilnyuvalysya lack free-market labor.</p><p class="rvps2"> farm lands of the Western developed very slowly. The economy led the country before agriculture, based on a feudal relationship. Serfdom was also the main obstacle to development into the local industry in manufactury factory.</p>
