<p class="a3"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">1. Arabian Peninsula and itspopulation</span></b></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Much of the vast Arabian peninsula, an area equala quarter of Europe - a desert and steppe. Arabia is divided into several differentareas of natural conditions. In the southwest peninsula stretches Yemenwith fertile land, rich tropical vegetation, high population density,which has long lived with the Farming and gardening. Mid-Peninsula - <span class="SpellE">Najd</span> (&quot;Upland&quot;) - a huge, arid plateauwhere only nomadic animal husbandry. There are no rivers, only a dry river bed, sometimesrain filled streams. Life-giving water to people only give a well.A long strip along the Red Sea - Hijaz (&quot;Frontier&quot;) - perhaps suitable forFarming in separate oazah. Boundless space, especially in the vicinityplateau, remains uninhabited.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Natural conditions of the Arabian Peninsularesulted in the fact that most Arabs were nomads - <b>Bedouins</b>(Desert dwellers), who bred goats, sheep and camels. Bedouin Lifeimpossible without the camel, the animal is - and inseparable companion toolexistence of nomadic Arabs.</span></p>

<p class="a0" style="margin: 4.25pt 0cm 4.25pt 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Camel is perfectly adapted to life in the desert, several days maydo without water. Bedouin eats his milk and meat, wears clothes fromcamel hair. In the desert, no trees or any other fuel, instead ofBedouins use it kizyaky Camel. NE The nomads live in tents withcamel felt, harness, saddles, shoes made from camel skin. Duringwandering camels, Bedouins are still called &quot;ships of the desert, carryingCargo and family treasure. Camel ruled by money, as the unit of calculation.Arabs believed they knew: if the water or lost in a desert caravan, oneput forward a camel - he will find water and road.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Bedouins tribes lived</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Which are divided into tribes and families. They existed to know - <b>Sheikh and <span class="SpellE">Said</span></b>Who had large flocks, and slaves receivedgreater share of mining in the war. All members of a tribe considered themselvesrelatives. Most Arabs worshiped various tribal gods: religion in commonthey do not exist. Among <span class="SpellE">most respected</span> were godwar and fertility <span class="SpellE">Astar</span>, Goddess of the moon <span class="SpellE">Sin</span>, The goddess-mother snake. Embodiment of their gods the Arabsconsidered man-made idols of stone and natural stone pillars. There were alsofew adherents of Judaism and Christianity.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In Hijaz along the Red Sealocated along the ancient trade route from the Mediterranean to Africa and Indiawhich resulted in large shopping centers that have turned into cities - Mecca <span class="SpellE">Yathrib</span> et al. Especially important was the mecca thattook place in the main bus caravans. Its inhabitants live in largemasonry buildings. Every year in Arabia, in the spring, four months stoppedWar robber attacks and installed a general peace. At this time, all the Arabscould visit the main sanctuary of Mecca - <span class="SpellE"><b>Kaaba</b></span>(In Arabic &quot;Cube&quot;), in which the wall was <span class="SpellE">vmurovano</span>black meteorite. At the same time in different competitions were arranged andgreat fair.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">At the end of Article VI.Arab society embraced the crisis. The population of the peninsula has increased, lackedland. Trade declined because of attacks of the Iranians who wanted to tradeways held Gulf Coast and enriched their country.Deteriorating living conditions pushed Arabs to think about the needmerge together to fight for better livelihood, but in the way of thiswere different tribal beliefs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 1.4pt;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Mohammed</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;"> argued that the major provisions of the newfaith given to him by God. Students and followers recorded his words. Afterdeath <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span> All these records were collected in onebook -<b> Koran </b>(In Arabic - &quot;read&quot;).<b></b></span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Resident Mecca <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span> belonged to the poorfamily. In the six years he remained an orphan and became a shepherd. Subsequently <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span> got a job to keep doing business rich widow<span class="SpellE">Khadija</span> and began to travel with merchant caravans.He soon married his mistress and got rich. After some time <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span> began to say that hears the voice of God telling himleave the trade and to preach a new religion. <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span>claimed that he - an instrument of God, the successor of the prophets Abraham, Moses and Jesus.

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The main religious requirement <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span> to the Arabs was to abandon the worship of differenttribal gods and recognize the existence of one God - Allah. <b>&quot;There is no godexcept Allah, and <span class="SpellE">Mohammed</span> - His prophet &quot;- the mainreligious formula of Islam</b>.
