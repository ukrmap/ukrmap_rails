<p class="a2"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">1. Reasons of strengtheningroyal power and unite the country </span></b></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">At the end of the tenth century. France was a change of dynasty. LatterCarolingian placement suffered the fate that their predecessors <span class="SpellE">Merovingians</span>.The founder of a new <span class="SpellE">dynasties</span> became one of the descendants of CountParis <span class="SpellE">Ed</span>That glorified his name during protectionCity of Norman - <span class="SpellE">Hugo</span> <span class="SpellE">Capet of France</span>.So the French government began a new <b style="">Dynasty<span class="SpellE">Capet</span></b> (987-1328 years).</span></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Board of a new dynasty began when <span class="SpellE">Frantsiyiya</span>going through difficult times of feudal disintegration. The first <span class="SpellE">Capet</span>had almost no power and recognized only &quot;first among equals.&quot; King did notwas even the strongest among the feudal lords. Master it was only in hisown possessions - <b>Royal</b> <b>domain</b> - Duchy <span class="SpellE">Ile-de-France</span>. It was a narrow strip of land that stretchedalong the river Seine and the Loire from Paris to Orleans and from all sides otochuvalysyaholdings of other feudal lords. Other dukes and earls held more oftenland than the king, and not yield to his power. But even in its own domainKing had to keep persevering against arbitrary barons whoabode in castles and not too afraid of his superior.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Representatives of the newDynasty did not want to put up with this situation and <b style="">у<span style=""> first half of XII century.Kings started to strengthen its authority, backed by differentpopulation of France</span></b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The period of <span class="SpellE">Kapetinhiv</span> coincided with the time when France, like all of Europe,experienced an economic boom. In</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">hastily developed agricultureIndustry, crafts, growing city. However, the development of restrained internecineand arbitrariness of feudal wars. Therefore, farmers, artisans and merchants were interested instrong royal power, which would unite the country and put an end to arbitrarinessfeudal lords. Kings skillfully used such situations and maintain cityprotect them in the fight against feudal landlords. Cities, in turn, helped Kingtame recalcitrant vassals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">With the development of feudal relations between management and farmers quicklychanged. Some feudal lords tried to force peasants to pay more, anddissatisfied villagers fled to the cities, others - liberated from dependence on farmers andrequiring only regular payment of money. To keep in subjection freevillagers and to find the fugitives, small and medium needed a strong feudalcentral government. They began to support the King. Some small knights,dissatisfied with their seniors, also sought justice in the king. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The church also sided with the King. She condemned the senseless internecine warin the country, during which thousands died. <b>Relying on the support of townspeople,small and medium-feudal lords and the church, French kings began fighting forreunification.</b></span></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a2"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">2. The beginning of the struggle for unificationFrance</span></b></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Start the XII century. a time to strengthen royal power. King <b>Louis VIThick</b> (1108 - 1137&#39;s) along with his assistant Abbe <span class="SpellE">Suheriyem</span> order cited in the royal domain. Locksrebellious barons were destroyed or are housed in the royal garrisons.</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Louis VI Thick different from their predecessors morepersistence and energy. He started a real war against the inhabitants&quot;Waspish nests that his country pozhyraly robberies,&quot; as contemporaries calledbarons. The king personally led the punitive forces, fought against the baronsorganized siege castles. Twenty years it took King to conquerrebellious barons. Especially hard was the struggle against Hugo de <span class="SpellE">Pyuyize</span>. He was excommunicated from the church, but it caused inBaron just laugh. Louis IV held three times in the siege of his castle, destroyed three timesand burning it, but nothing ever did. Every where <span class="SpellE">Pyuyize</span>gave promise of obedience to the king, restored the castle, and it started again. Onlyafter the third defeat he skoryvsya.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The fight for the unification of Louis VIthe country was gradually paying off. Evidence of this are the followingevents. In 1124 King Henry I of England with a GermanEmperor Henry V went to war against the King of France. In this hard toFrench day <b>first time in history, all vassals Northern Franceunited around their king, who ensured the victory.</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">At the end of his life Louis VImanaged to achieve, as all thought, a great strengthening of royal power, ozhenyvshy17-year-old son <b>Louis VII</b> (1137 - 1180&#39;s) with 15-year-oldEleonora <span class="SpellE">Aquitaine</span>. After his father&#39;s death Eleanor desolationwas the only heir <span class="SpellE">Acquitaine</span> - A hugeduchy in the south. However, for some time, Louis VII hadEleonora negligence divorce, she married Henry II <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span>Which in 1154 became king of England, andbrought him in possession possession. Thus, a person close toCombat <span class="SpellE">Capet</span> France became a unificationenglish <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span>. By the middle of the XII century. undertheir power was almost half of France. Possession <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span>,considered to be vassals of the French King, several times larger domainlatter. French kings had to begin a long and exhaustingfight <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span> association with France.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Significant progress in the fight for unionFrench lands under royal authority of Louis VII son reached the king <span class="SpellE"><b>Philippe</b></span><b> Augustus II</b>(1180 - 1223&#39;s). <span class="SpellE">Philippe</span>II wasKing at 15 years of age, but he disappointed those who expected him toinexperience. Vigorous and wary, distrustful and deceitful, he managedachieve brilliant success in the fight against <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Philippe</span>II accused King Henry II of Englandto institute vassal obligations (as <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span>were his vassals) and simultaneously took the oath of a vassal of his sonssupporting their struggle against the father.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Fighting <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span> ended in complete victory <span class="SpellE">Philippe</span>II. During 1202 - 1214 рр.he conquered most of the French possessions <span class="SpellE">Plantagenet</span>.Then the royal domain area increased several times. In addition,son of Philip II, Louis Leo VIII (1223-1226 biennium) usedAlbihoyskymy Wars (1209-1229 biennium) for connecting many SouthFrance. He rozoryv pryluchyv and to seize the Duchy of Toulouse.</span></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a2"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">3. Board <span style="">St. Louis IX</span></span></b></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">At the time of the Board granddaughter <span class="SpellE">Philippe</span> II - King <b>LouisIX St.</b> (1226 - 1270&#39;s) There were great wars, butwas held on changes in state administration, strengthened the royal authoritypower.</span></p>

<p class="a0" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Louis IXbecame king when he was 11 years. When he became of age, theshowed himself a worthy successor of his grandfather&#39;s business <span class="SpellE">Philippe</span>II.At a time when power was a decisive moment on, Louis IXsurprised everyone with its adherence to the law. When his old enemy, KingEngland, had quarreled with his barons, both sides decided to seekto Louis IX, that he found out who was right. Maybe baronscounted while the fact that the French king to support them, but in vain:Louis IX gave a verdict in favor of King.</span></p>

<p class="a1" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">InLouis IX the country tried to achieve the rule of law. They said thatEvery day, King allegedly came from his palace at the appointed time, got undertree, and listened rozbyrav complaint of any person.</span></p>

<p class="a1" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Unusual for contemporaries weregreat kindness and piety of the king. He arranged for shelters and maimedpoor people. At the Royal Palace in the room for the royal meals dailytable covered with beggars and cripples. King personally followed them toreceived the same food, as he was. Louis IX took part in the seventh andeighth Crusades. When he bought from captivity after unsuccessful seventhCrusade, Louis IX had returned home, and left to waitNew Crusaders in Palestine. For three years spent there, the French Kingearned fame of the saint. He made a barefoot pilgrimage in plain clothes to <span class="SpellE">Nazareth</span>, Worked as a bricklayer and a simple left buriedadrift corpses of dead Christians. Only the news of the death of his mother forcedhis return to France, which remained for six years without their king.Respect for King Louis IX was so great, that has passed and 20 yearsChurch proclaimed him a saint.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">By Louis IX of France wascreated a small royal council - meeting the King continued with his closestsupporters. There was a royal domain <b>fights banned</b>as a means of resolving legal disputes. If a person is not agreed with the decision <span class="SpellE">senyorialnoho</span> or city court, it could apply to<b>Royal Court</b> - Paris Parliament proceedings. He became the highestCourt of France. The most important case (arson, chasing counterfeit money,abduction of women and others.) dealt exclusively in the royal court. Couldturn to him and those who lived in areas not linked to the royaldomain.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Of order in the state and reducenumber of wars between the feudal ban contributed to wage wars of Louis IX onterritory of its domain and set policies <b>&quot;40 days of the King&quot;</b>That there werethroughout the kingdom. Under this rule, between the declaration of war and itsinstalled beginning in the 40-day period during which the weaker party couldappeal seeking justice for the King.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Louis IXlaunched in France <b>creating a single monetary system</b>. King did notbanned seniors mint their own coins (right to mint coins then had40 seniors), but made them as his vassals, to permit in their possessionroyal coin along with her. Gradually the royal coin, whichdistinguished by high quality, replaced with traffic worse than the quality of local money.The introduction of a single monetary system contributed to the economic unitycountry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Great territorial gains in the yearsrule of Louis IX was implemented, although increased royalpossession. Louis IX was signed for a utility agreement with EnglishKing, which he finally refused to claims for lost earlierprovince. King of England retained only for a <span class="SpellE">Aquitaine</span>;for this he had to accept a vassal of the French king.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Louis IXrepeatedly said that his rule is to peace and justice in the country andabroad. Activities King was evidence of his desire to implement theseideas: <b>during the reign of Louis IX, France got stronger as the onlyState and achieved economic prosperity</b>. It is not famous as dayLouis IX golden age in the history of the country.</span></p>

At the same time lost the sense of a universal state undersupremacy of the emperor or the pope. The two most significant nationalkingdoms in Western Europe were France and England. The rivalry between themresulted in a long conflict, which was named <b>Hundred Years War</b> (1337 -1453). - It was the first armed conflict of the European dimension inwhich battles interspersed with long truce.

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">One reason for the conflict in the choirfeudal system of government. English king, as vassals of the FrenchKing, but with significant holdings in France, stood in the way of a singleFrench state. A second important reason for war was the rivalry betweenEngland and France through Flanders. French kings sought to conquervassal, but essentially independent county.
