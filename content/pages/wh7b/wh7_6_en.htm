<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Any significant financial transactionsimpossible without a system of loans. People who borrowed money at interest, called<b>usurers</b>. Usury was quite common since the introduction ofmoney. Money is needed by all, and they are few.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">During the Middle Ages, the bulk of paymentscarried out in cash</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">. Given that while inmonetary circulation was a lot of different gold and silver coins minted invarious cities in Europe and Asia, became urgent profession <span class="SpellE"><b>changed</b></span>.In exchange the coins, they also monitored and their quality, because counterfeit money (fromadmixture of base metals) and cracked (weight did not meet face value)happened quite often. <b>In the XIV century. userers changed and became the foundersbanks</b>. First Bank provided two basic services: save money andprovide loans, that money borrowed for a fee (with interest).Developed a new calculation system: bills. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Bill</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;"> - A document whereby one person instructs another to pay a certain amount anda city of a third party specified in the document.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">For example, if a merchant <span class="SpellE">L</span> would buy goods in Venice, he was notneed to travel with cash to the city, but it was enough to make the required amountthe office that represented his Venetian trading partner,get a bill, which, along with the order to send to Venice and getproduct.

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">With the appearance of cities arose and system management. At the head ofthere was a person or group intended seniors, on land whichcity was located, or selected the most residents.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Appearing on the landsfeudal lord, the city depended on it, and were obliged to pay or vidroblyaty,like a peasant community tax. Craftsmen gave part of theirproducts, merchants - paid goods or money, others - worked on serfdomor perform other work. Cities obtyazhuvala such dependence, the residents wantednytysya-releasing from it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Fighting citiesfor freedom and privileges opened in the XI - XIII centuries</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">. To address seniors townsfolk united in unions - <b>Commune</b>.After the uprising, gifts of kings who fought against the strengthening of governmentseniors, or redemption by the city government sought the law: aown elected authorities, courts, police, militia, tax, treasury,laws, etc.. Those who have gained self-government, was called <b>communes</b>.
<b></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The most importantcommunes achievement - the achievement of personal independence of people</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">First appeared in the communeNorthern Italy in the XI century. Living in cities, using the struggle betweenpapamy and emperors, proclaimed his government. All attempts by Frederick I<span class="SpellE">Barbarossa</span> suppress this movement were unsuccessful. Finally,he was forced to resign, and communal movement is spreading Europe. ButNot all cities have managed to achieve self-government rights. Where there was strongersuperior power, success communes were only temporary. The symbol of the selfwas <b>City Hall</b> - Premises where located controls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt; line-height: 12.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Achieving freedom is not always meant to have justice. Afterindependence to power in the cities came mainly bourgeasy that couldestablish such laws that the rest of the inhabitants found themselves in worse conditions thanit was in the superior. Growl there was none, because the courts also controlledpatrician. In XIII-XIV centuries. cities communes wave of rebellionsplebs against the patricians, which ended with the increase of the lower strata of humanurban population.</span></p>

Thus the development of handicrafts, trade, banking contributedundermining of subsistence and development of new - trade. Citieschanged the image of medieval life. So city residents markedlydiffered not only from rural employment. They looked at the world differently,were more energetic, have relied mainly on their strength and their hordylysyasuccess.

Theyalways slow, while appreciated, is no accident that the first clock appeared in the city.City residents wanted to succeed, trying to get rich and increase what theydostavalosya inherited. Many in the cities faced adventurer, adventurers,fraud, ie people who are at any cost were ready to win covetedwealth. Their understanding of wealth gave freedom and liberty - the largestvalue of the city.
