<p class="1" style=""><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial;">1.Kultura early Middle Ages</span></b></p>

<p class="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial;">The firstcentury Middle Ages called &quot;dark ages&quot; and are unlikely to be calledfavorable to the progress of culture. However, during this period wasbirth of a new European medieval culture, which drew its beginningswith ancient heritage, culture barbarians and Christianity. First results of suchinteractions become noticeable during <i style="">&quot;Carolingianrevival.</i> It called the rise of culture in Frankish kingdom byduring the reign of Charlemagne and his immediate successors. It was the firstHistory of Medieval Europe and the conscious expression of deep interest in ancientculture and education. At the same time Great Kal do not forget about their Germanicorigin, and commanded to collect Germanic antiquities and ancient interestFrankish songs.</span></p>

<p class="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial;">HimselfCharles was well at that time, education: he knew Greek and Latin, lovedread books, but write so by the end of life and not learned. He is invited toinvolve themselves and to public administration scholars from across Europe. They createdcircle at the court of the emperor under the name &quot;Academy&quot; - such as the philosophicalGreek philosopher Plato&#39;s school - where she, in the presence of Charles, worksancient philosophers and theologians of the church, made up poems, freely exchangingviews on various topics debated.</span></p>

<p class="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial;">Bywith members of the &quot;Academy&quot; Carl founded the Bishopric of school facilities, whereeducated people were preparing for governance. He issued a decreeCompulsory education of all children of free people. Organization of the schools andwriting the first in their textbooks engaged faithful ally of Charles Saxon <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Alkuin</b></span><b style="">. </b>However, the order could not be done vialack of enough teachers. Of the schools, based at CharlesBishopric, later medieval universities there. The school, which preparedpeople to public administration, existed at the court. </span></p>

<p class="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial;">CharlesGreat interest in history. In his order gathered and rewritten oldRoman and Greek manuscripts. He instructed to record all annual eventsoccurred in the state. These records are called <b>annals</b> (From Lat. <span class="SpellE">annus</span> - Year). He orders built stone palaces andcathedrals, new roads were laid. Charlemagne initiated a grand projectcanal between the Rhine and Danube, which had connecting the North Sea to the Black(The project was not implemented at that time).</span></p>

<p class="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial;">Culturalgrowth had become apparent and fairly broad construction. It was constructed over300 palaces, cathedrals, churches and monasteries. </span></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In his residence in <span class="SpellE">Aachen</span> Karl built the majestic<span class="SpellE">Dvirtseva</span> complex. In the center was a large hallfor receptions, imperial chambers. Lateral wing of the complex, where thereschools, libraries, archives, `yednuvalo hall Choir - <span class="SpellE">Dvirtseva</span>church. Church, which survived to the present, adorned sculpturescolumns and mosaics. But it was all taken away from Italy - was feeling the shortagemasters, who would be all it could do. Contemporaries estimated the chapel as a &quot;miraclestrange and high beauty. She was a shining example.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">„<span class="SpellE">Karolinska</span> Communities &quot;was short. Itnot pose any known masterpieces. But because it saved a lot ofancient heritage and laid the foundation for prosperity in the futureMedieval European culture. </span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the next two centuries (IX-X cent.) Again observed in culturedecline and they &quot;shut&quot; behind the walls of monasteries. </span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a1"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">2. Scholastic. Thomas Aquinas</span></b></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the silence of the monastery walls were the most favorable conditions to reflect on the eternal.Thinking people in the Middle Ages, educated in Christian dogma, was interested primarilythe whole problem relationship God, the universe and man. None of themdenied the existence of God. Most arguments between medieval philosophersraised questions as relate faith and reason. But without the development of conceptswithout a clear logical thinking can not reach the truth, to understanding the subjectstudy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Growth in interest in Western knowledgeEurope contributed to that through the European intellectuals Arabs closeracquainted with the works of great thinkers of antiquity. The greatest influence onthe Western science had labor <span class="SpellE">Aristotle</span>.On the basis of his works medieval scholars developed a method of logical thinking andcognition. This method of knowing the world and God was named <b>scholasticism</b>Thatderived from the word &quot;school&quot;. Scholastic came out of that faith and knowledgerevelation and reason can not just reconcile, but also help each other teach.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Scholastics taught thatknow the truth need to mind does not deviate from the letter of Scripture, and tological chain of proof has crept none that could lead todeception. Therefore scholastics lot of attention to technique thought - <b>logic</b>. InAncient scholars thought they borrowed method <b>syllogism -</b> specialinference, which on the basis of several (usually two) different judgmentsappears new. For example:</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">1. No one justknows.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">2. The scientist - a man.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Conclusion: scientistall one knows.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">To the knowledge of the scholasticsrarely used methods such as research and experiment. They was notrequired because the main source of knowledge for their logical construction was a holidayScripture.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Later, when mankindgripped by the desire deeper the world, when research and experiment have become majorsource of new knowledge, the word &quot;scholasticism&quot; acquired negative traits, which meantfruitless thoughts, knowledge, bookish, endless dry logicalbuilding that did not give any result. But by then it was a big stepforward in human knowledge of the universe. Scholastics called themselves &quot;dwarfs thatstanding on the shoulders of giants &quot;(ie on the shoulders of the ancient philosophers), but because theysee further than their predecessors.</span></p>

<p class="a0" style="margin: 8.5pt 0cm 0.0001pt 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In sholastytsi distinguished three maindirections that were sharp disagreements among themselves. The main issue that causeddifferences between different areas of scholastics, was the problem <span class="SpellE"><b>universals</b></span> - General concepts (man, machineetc.).</span></p>

<p class="a3" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Some of them, <b>realists</b>,argued that <span class="SpellE">universals</span> existed for life,being in God&#39;s mind. Combined with the matter, they are embodied inspecific things.</span></p>

<p class="a3" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Another group - <b>nominalist</b>- Argued that <span class="SpellE">universals</span> is the product of mentalof a man who learns some things. In other words, learn some stuff, mandistinguishes them something in common, which merged into the general concept. </span></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The third group of scholastics - <b>kontseptualisty</b> - Occupied, so to speak,intermediate position. They argued that any thing kryye a generalconcept.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The peak of activity was the medieval scholasticism <b>Thomas Aquinas </b>(1225- 1274). He was born into a noble Italian family. Raised inthe famous monastery of St.. Benedict <span class="SpellE">Monte Cassino</span>,studied at the University of Naples. The family supported his desirea monk, but until I heard that he wants to dedicate his life tozhebruschym Order of St. Dominica. Despite the ban, he fled the house andentered the Dominican Order. As a monk, he studied in Paris andCologne. Students nedolyublyuvaly high, smooth, witty, quiet, goodThomas and mild. Even gave him the nickname &quot;dumb ox.&quot; But his teacherAlbert the Great was able to discern in Fomi great talent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Home work ThomasAquinas &quot;Sum of Theology&quot; united all ancient views about God and man.Each section contains a discussion of the work of any philosophical thought, itdenial and statement of the conclusion that the author thinks is right. <b>DesignedThomas Aquinas was later to teaching the Catholic church official ascontained some &quot;evidence&quot; the existence of God.</b></span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In scholasticism in the Middle Ages there was another area that led her fiercecontroversy. This direction in philosophy called mysticism.</span></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Mystics rejected the need for logical proof of the foundations of faith. Theybelieved that the foundations of faith and pious prayers recognizable reflections withouthelp, as they said, &quot;pagan science. That is, they arguedsense of superiority over the mind. They believed that only in his mind, detached fromIndeed, a person can communicate with God. From this conclusion was made thatperson to conduct charitable life and fight against sin.</span></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Mysticism became especially widespread in the XIV - XV centuries. WhenEuropean civilization crisis struck, and all the people turned to God.</span></p>

<p class="a3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">At the end of the XIV century. in the Netherlands is a religious movement thatespoused the idea of mysticism. The founder was <span class="SpellE">Gerard</span>
<span class="SpellE">Groot</span>. Being a wealthy man, he refusedwealth and became a preacher. Despite the risk of being accusedof heresy, his students founded the secular society that lives were similar toChernets&#39;ke. They preach individual <span class="SpellE">worship</span>God and a close relationship with him. The principles of this movement was put in the work Thomas <span class="SpellE">Kempiyskoho</span> &quot;On the imitation of Christ&quot; (1427), wheredescribes the meaning of love of God to man and God&#39;s grace.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a1"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">3. Schools and Universities</span></b></p>

<p class="a1" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Educated people in the Middle Ages wasrelatively few. In the early Middle Ages, as you know, educated peoplelived mostly in monasteries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The rise of Europe that began in X century. Caused thirst for knowledge andneed for educated people. Education began to go beyond the monasteries.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In medieval Europe can distinguish three levels of schools. Lower Schoolwere attached to churches, monasteries, giving elementary knowledge of those who woulddevote themselves to serving God. It studied the Latin language, which was conductedworship, prayer and the very order of worship. Secondary schools oftenformed near the residences of bishops. They studied seven &quot;free science&quot; -grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, geometry. Last containedgeography, astrology and music. The first three were science &quot;<span class="SpellE">tryvium &quot;</span>,four -<span class="SpellE">kvadryvium &quot;</span>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Since the XI century. Europe&#39;s emerging high schools, which are subsequentlycalled universities (from Lat. <span class="SpellE">universitas</span> -set). The name was derived from the fact that the first universities werecommunities, which brings together teachers and students (students still called University<span class="SpellE">alma</span> <span class="SpellE">Mater</span> - Sweet mother).These associations had their own distinct rules, the structure andclaimed its independence from the authority of the city where theylocated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The first such association emerged in the Italian cities <span class="SpellE">Salerno</span>and Bologna, studied medicine and Roman law. During the XII - XIII century.number of universities has grown steadily. The most famous was the Paris (<span class="SpellE">Sorbonne</span>), Oxford and Cambridge (England) <span class="SpellE">Salamanca</span> (In Spain) and others. In 1500 Europethere were 65 universities.</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Model for universities in Europe was the University of Paris. He came back infirst half of XII century. and there was a &quot;free school&quot;. In 1200King of France <span class="SpellE">Philippe</span> II of France gave the &quot;school&quot;special rights. The university had four faculties: artistic(Preparatory, which studied &quot;seven free sciences), medical, legal,Theology (Philosophy). </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Teaching in universities was conducted in Latinlanguage. This gave students the opportunity to start training in one, and ending inanother. There is no clear course of study at universities was not, and so someStudents learned a long time. Students who traveled from oneuniversity to another, called <span class="SpellE"><b>vahantamy</b></span>(Vagrants). The main forms of training were lectures and debates betweenprofessors. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">One of the firstinterest in science professor at Oxford University found a monkFranciscan Order <span class="SpellE"><b>Roger</b></span><b> Bacon</b>.He argued that knowledge can not get into theological disputes, butstudying nature through experiments. Bacon made many discoveries.He gave special importance to mathematics, physics, chemistry, trying to createmicroscope and telescope, explained the origin of the rainbow.

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Commoners, who in his life differed significantly from other segmentsmedieval society, too vytvoryly own culture. Urban Culturehad a secular character and was closely connected with folk art. Amongurban dwellers were popular poetical tales, jokes, which describeswitted residents of cities that have found a way out of any difficult situations.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Bright display urban culture had in the development literature. The best knownand beloved piece of urban residents was the French &quot;Roman for Fox, which undertype of animals of all strata of medieval society - feudal lords,Kings, priests, burghers.

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the Middle Ages, books were rare. This is explained by the fact that each bookwas the original manuscript, as well as the fact that literate people were few.Books were written on specially treated calf or sheep&#39;s clothing - parchment.Parchment was enduring, strong and beautiful, but very expensive. Another waywas and book cover. Also decorated with pictures of the book - bookthumbnails. Therefore especially valuable books in monastic libraries were kept attsepu.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Increasing number of educated people, spreading the paper led to increasingdemand for their books cheaper. There were workshops on mass census books. InXIV - XV centuries. interest in the written text has grown significantly, especially the WordGod. To meet growing demand, it was necessary to think about newmethod of producing books. In the early XV century. in Europe, the firstbooks, prints made with carved on plates texts. Butthis way was time consuming and does not meet the needs of the time, besidescopyist worked faster than this model produced a printed book.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Around 1445 German craftsman <span class="SpellE"><b>Johan</b></span><b>

<p class="a1"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">9. Architecture and art</span></b></p>

<p class="a1"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">During XI - XV centuries. other known two major artistic styleszastupaly each other - Romanesque and Gothic.</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The first style -Romanesque - ruled in XI - XII centuries., the second - the Gothic - in the XII - XV centuries.These styles most clearly manifested in the architecture of castles and churches.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Romanesque castle, accommodation and defensefeudal structure, characterized by massiveness forms, which gave him specialmonumentality and the surrounding fortress walls reinforced that impression. Allarchitectural appearance of the castle gave an idea of the power of his prince.Romanesque cathedral, characterized by the same style, was to embody the ideamajesty and power of the church. The basis of the Romanesque cathedral lay Roman planpublic (secular) buildings - the Basilica.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In the first years of Romanesque architecturethe issue of overlapping stone building. It is technically challengingit was decided the construction of <span class="SpellE">napivtsyrkulyarnoho</span> vaultin building a Romanesque masters have made remarkable skill.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">An example of Romanesquebuildings may serve <span class="SpellE"><b>Vormskyy</b></span><b> cathedral</b>(Germany) with a massive stone arches, massive walls prop.The small windows pierced in the thick walls and similar to bell, horizontaldivision walls <span class="SpellE">napivtsyrkulyarnymy</span> arches only emphasizegrandeur and monumentality strict construction. Clear architectural grandeurenhances the sculpture, which only conditionally passes phenomenon. </span></p>

<p class="a1" style="margin-bottom: 1.4pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the XII - XV centuries. inWestern Europe grew rapidly and developed cities. Bloomed and newarchitectural style, which later was named <b>Gothic</b>And then hecalled <b>new French manner</b>. In the XII - XIII century. Franceis the rapid construction has been prepared, which, according to scientists atconstruction of temples has been spent over the stone than in ancient Egypt.Among the buildings erected at that time, strike the imagination and now Cathedral in Reims and<span class="SpellE">Amiens</span>, And Lani <span class="SpellE">Bove</span>, <span class="SpellE">Chartres</span> and Paris. The foundations of these buildings were set ondepth of 10 meters, and their towers rising to a height of 40-storey building.These majestic cathedrals were fit almost all the inhabitants of that time. Yes <span class="SpellE">Am&#39;yenskyy</span> Cathedral vmischav 10 000 believers. </span></p>

<p class="a0"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Gothic</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> - One of the few whose date of definedsure. Abbot of Saint-Denis, the tomb of French kings, <span class="SpellE"><b>Suheriy</b></span>(1080 - 1141) would provide an unusual form of his abbey church. Basedworks on Greek theologian Dionysius, who lived in the V century., <span class="SpellE">Suheriy</span>believed that divine beauty can be transferred through the creation of beautiful things.From this it appeared that the architecture of the church has held the beauty, ease and grandeur. In1137 this idea was implemented. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The main features of the new style werethin walls, high arched ceiling rapid, large windows, decorated with coloredstained glass.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">All this can be achieved onlythanks to the new system and Engineering building. The design relied on the bearingframe erected outside the cathedral. This allowed the buildersbuild cathedrals unprecedented heights with thin walls and large steepwindows. Verticalization building has become an important feature of the Gothic style.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The emergence of large windows gave rise toflowering of stained glass. In the XIII century. they spread across Europe. Stained Glass - amosaic of colored glass, which by means of communication (in the Middle Agesused lead) was connected to a song. Stained Glass in Catholicchurches depicted biblical subjects and took the painting. The real miracle remainCathedral stained glass <span class="SpellE">Chartres</span>. 173 stained area of 2000 square meters. mmade in XII - XIII century., evoke biblical subjects.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Another important element is the Gothic sculpture, which sings like,fills the building movement. Gothic sculpture in the temple played a role, onehand, architectural decorations, but on the other - encyclopedia of knowledge and understanding of theworld of medieval man. Along with the statues of saints, angels, JesusChrist, the Virgin Mary, the demons were sculptures of ordinary people. Moreover, allsculpture acquired human traits of character. So in the depths of Gothic styleshoots emerged interest in human world in which she lives. This nuancealready developed for the next era - the Renaissance. </span></p>

<p class="a1"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">10. Early Renaissance humanism and</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Late Middle Ages in Western Europe culture change. Theywere caused by many factors. One of the main one was that the man wasrely on their own strength and not humbly submit to the behavior of thegroup to which she belonged. Personal interest, commitment to successfocus on a new path opened up in human development. Man begins tonew look at the world, to itself, to <span style="">&nbsp;</span>man&#39;s place in the world. These new viewscoincided with a period of intense interest in antiquity. Antiquity consideredideal period in history when science flourished, the arts, the State andsocial life. Proof of this are the things that the ancient manuscripts,are impressed by its excellence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The above was most noticeable in Italy, where boiled urban life andremains of antiquity lay directly under their feet. Expressions to antiquityaccompanied by efforts to revive and imitate it. That is why the new epoch,started called <b style="">Revival</b>Orin French <b style="">Renaissance</b>. Althoughactually was not revival, and a new culture, which uniteselements of ancient and medieval. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">From the fourteenth century. lovers of antiquity based on the knowledge gained considered thatshould primarily be engaged &quot;<span class="SpellE">studia</span> <span class="SpellE">humanitatis”</span> that &quot;human learning&quot;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who have studied men with late fifteenth century.were called <b style="">humanists</b>. OnCurrently, the word &quot;humanism&quot; we call love for people and so understandingworld in which man is the highest value.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In those times humanist could become anyone who passionately loved antiquity andhad time and ability to learn it. But in reality there were very few humanists.They massed in <span class="SpellE">numerically small</span> groups. However, knowledgethese people gave them the opportunity to occupy high positions in Italian cities,in the office of kings, cardinals and popes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In contrast to the Christian humanists have made their own virtues, the most importantof which proclaimed the dignity and valor. Although all were sincere humanitariansChristians. Each of the humanists sought to become fully developed humancapable of creativity in various fields of science, literature and art, iebecome a &quot;universal man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">On the threshold of great culture was the famous Renaissance poet and philosopher <b style="">Dante `Alih yeri</b> (1265-1321 biennium). LifeIt was not easy. He was born in Florence and is very fond of their city, butmost of his life was forced to live in exile. Taking an active part inpolitical struggle, he was in the camp and who lost. He started writing earlypoems. All of them were devoted to one girl - <span class="SpellE">Beatrice</span>.As a boy Dante saw it on the children&#39;s holiday and passionately loved her at alllife, though seldom able to see her only from afar - in church or on the street. Itself <span class="SpellE">Beatrice</span> became the wife of another and died early. MostDante&#39;s famous work &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot; Comedy in those days called works ofhappy end of unusual events heroes. Divine called for her outstanding artisticperformance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">For his work Dante chose the form of visions: in a dark forest, he suddenlymeets the famous Roman poet <span class="SpellE">Virhiliya</span>With whichdeparting flights to the other world. With him he held nine circlesHell, then with the other heroes Purgatory and Paradise. Poem tells of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Italy, Florence. Popes, emperors, monksand saints and sages of ancient generals. Its main character - Dante himself and hiscontemporaries. And some he severely criticized by other admires. Everyone who meetsDante in the next world continue to experience this life passions: anger,Pride, contempt. It is this aggravation passions are saturated worldwas new to the literature.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Yes, if Dante was a predecessor of the Renaissance, the first Renaissance mancan definitely be called <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Francesco</b></span><b style=""> Petrarch </b>(1304-1374 biennium) It does nothe held no official position, but was so well known that in his opinionwere considered kings and popes. Petrarch glorified &quot;Book of Songs&quot; - 366 poems (sonnets)dedicated to his beloved Laura. Like Dante, he fell in love with Laura in childhood.But his love for her remained undivided. Laura herself died of the epidemicplague. For his poetic talents he, as in ancient times, was crownedlaurel wreath on Roman <span class="SpellE">Capitol</span>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Follower and friend of Petrarch was <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Giovanni</b></span><b style=""> Boccaccio</b>(1313-1375 biennium). He also wrote poems about his beloved Mary. But his famebrought the collection of a hundred stories &quot;Decameron.&quot; Stories written on behalf ofcheerful company of seven girls and three boys in furthering the ten daysare in the country house, hiding from the plague. In furtheringten days they zabavlyaly each other all sorts of life storieslove, separation, travel, adventure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">All the above works were written in Italian folk live.This they proved that people&#39;s language can be written outstanding works from, transfer allrange of feelings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Among the founders were a new culture and artists. Due artthis period was the appearance of linear perspective. Medieval artists alwayspaintings depicting more meaningful figure things more, regardless of wherethey are depicted: on the front or back seat. Paintings in linear perspectiveportrayed as the human eye sees the world: objects in the foregroundlarger in the rear - lower. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Alsoartist tries to convey the individual traits of his character.Quick take a picture spread of secular character, appears sonew genre, like a portrait.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">As Dante in literature and art in a new culture founded Florentine <b style="">Giotto where <span class="SpellE">Bondone</span>
</b>(1266-1337 biennium). According to legend, when he fed the sheep in his childhood, hestones painted pictures of nature, which he saw. Once passed nearartist. Who said: &quot;The Lord has given you great talent.&quot; Since childrencapture is turning into a professional activity Giotto. He painted portraits,icons, frescoes. His first major work was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>mural dedicated to the life of St. Francis. The most famous workGiotto was painting the church in <span class="SpellE">Padua</span>. In the frescoes hedepicted Jesus, Virgin Mary, the apostles as the earth&#39;s people - intelligent, honest,beautiful, hard spirit. On their faces human emotions and experiences. Scene&quot;Kiss of Judas&quot; shows the artist&#39;s attitude and evangelical events. Giottodid a lot for your hometown and was buried as an outstanding citizen inCathedral City. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Physicality of objects container shapes, linear perspective in its entirety for the first timewith appeared in Florentine art <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Masaccio</b></span> (1401-1428 biennium). Although he lived a short life,he managed to get loud glory. The most notable was the scene of the Expulsion from Paradise &quot;withMurals of one of the Florentine churches.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">All of these artists studied at the Renaissance paintings of Giotto and <span class="SpellE">Mazochcho</span>. Early peak <span class="SpellE">Revived</span>in art is painting <b style="">Sandro <span class="SpellE">Botticelli</span></b> (1445-1510 biennium). His painting &quot;Spring&quot;&quot;Birth of Venus Beauty convey an understanding of both internal and external artistsRenaissance. </span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Recovery Principles are reflected in the sculpture. SoFlorentine <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Donatello</b></span>(Bl.1386-1466) revived the ancient tradition, departing frommedieval traditions, has created a round sculpture. This statue wascreation of an independent artist, not part of the decoration of the house. It couldcontemplate on all sides. Foremost works <span class="SpellE">Donatello</span>steel sculpture Bible <span class="SpellE">David</span>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">The origins of culture in Renaissance architecture laid the architect and sculptor <b style="">Filippov <span class="SpellE">Brunelleschi</span></b>(1377-1446 biennium). He developed the laws of linear perspective and ordered the solutiondifficult engineering task to create a huge dome over the cathedral.The main thing in his work was the creation of the dome of the cathedral <span class="SpellE">Santa Maria del Fore</span>in Florence.</span></p>
