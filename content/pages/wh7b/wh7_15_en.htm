<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Sometimes the appearance of the Eastern Roman Empireor Byzantium, see 395, when Emperor Theodosius the Great peredilyvempire between his sons. During the barbarian invasion cunningEmperors of Constantinople managed to save their possessions and to directbarbarians on earth of the Western Roman Empire. Then, when Western Europe lay inruins of the Byzantine empire flourished and fixings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Byzantium was a multinationalState</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">.
