<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Beginning of the Middle Ages was characterized by the fact that in Europefacing fundamentally new form of state that differed from previous ones. Itsthey are beginning to unions Germanic tribes that moved into western borderRoman Empire. Destroyed an empire and conquering its territory and population (byrecent estimates of scientists conquerors constituted about 5% of the Surrenderedpopulation), tribal leaders face a problem of management of these territories.The existing system of power was of little use, and Roman was actually destroyedand could not be revived. In addition, the leaders met resistance <span class="SpellE">sopleminnykiv</span>,who could not understand why rushatsya old traditions and tribal authorities.</span></p>

<p class="a0"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Frankish historian Gregory <span class="SpellE">Turskiy</span> on casevaluable in a bowl <span class="SpellE">Suasoni</span></span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

<p class="a0" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt 1cm; text-indent: 14.15pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Duringconquest of Gaul army <span class="SpellE">Clovis</span> Franks captured ina church along with other gems in large bowl of magnificent beauty. Bishopthat church turned to <span class="SpellE">Clovis</span> askingreturn at least the cup.

Doing so, as you thinknecessary, because no one can resist your <span class="SpellE">power &quot;</span>.When they answered yes, a silly, jealous and fiery warrior, crying,raised his ax, rozrubav cup and said: &quot;None of this will not get you, exceptwhat is yours by <span class="SpellE">lot &quot;</span>. All wereimpressed, but the king took offense patiently and humbly.</span></p>

<p class="a1" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Per year <span class="SpellE">Clovis</span>commanded to gather his forces with weapons on Mars field to check inthe state held a weapon.

Thy spear, sword and ax - everything nowhere <span class="SpellE">sake &quot;</span>.And, snatching his ax and threw it on the ground. When he leaned on hisax, King rozrubav his head his ax and said: &quot;Yes you did withChalice in <span class="SpellE">Suasoni &quot;</span>. When a soldier died <span class="SpellE">Clovis</span> commanded to return home, the actvselyvshy in them great fear.</span></p>

<br style="" clear="ALL">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Something similar happened in other barbarickingdoms. Although the established political system was flawed, shaky,weak, dependent on the personality of the monarch, it nevertheless laid the first foundationsmedieval kingdoms.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the kingdom of the Visigoths, which existed in Spain is Kinghanded over his power by inheritance, and was elected. At first the members of one family bycry and slam. Then some families really launched armed struggle forcrown. As a result, none of the Gothic dynasty no more than threegenerations. Finally in 633</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">р. <span class="SpellE">Toledskyy</span>Church makes a decision on ordering the election, and in 672 was introducesfirst coronation as confirmation equity choice. Electoral systemmonarch Franks called &quot;the disease <span class="SpellE">Goths &quot;</span> and believedthat the monarch has the authority to transfer an inheritance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">State created its creators had been thinking about itfate. In their eyes it was the same property, like everything else. And with propertyin their view, should act justly - divided between the children (descendants). Thatwas done. However, such hostility revolved justice, fight forpower between generations. As a result - lost most barbarian kingdoms.Generally, this disastrous tradition for a long time will ruin the medieval stateuntil awareness comes integrity and indivisibility of the state.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In early medieval accounts for the emergence of another formstate, which claimed to totality and universality. So the power ofCharlemagne, who was proclaimed Emperor, was merged most of the land<span class="SpellE">West</span> Christian world. There wasrevival &quot;of the Roman <span class="SpellE">Empire</span>. But it was alreadyand not Empire. Unlike its predecessor, it was not hardpower and extensive management systems, unified system of taxation. Asbarbarian kingdoms, it skriplyuvalasya principle of personal devotion.A powerful ruler - given subject, a weak ruler - all equally dedicatedservants. In the Middle Ages &quot;Rome <span class="SpellE">Empire</span> was ratherdream, ghosts, rather than a reality to which no one wanted the ruler of Europe. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thus, no barbarian kingdoms, nor an empireCharlemagne, has not created a stable system of government.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Feudalfragmentation</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the collapse of the empire of Charlemagne&#39;s thronedecline. It was strictly related to many factors. So successors werebezdaramy, that Western Europe has experienced a new invasion: the Normans, Magyars (Hungarians)Saracens. But the main reason was that in the previous centuryformed raids. Their chief lords besides wealthMiddle - earth, have dominion over it and its inhabitants. &quot;No land withouthost &quot;- was said then. This would enable them to feel free inrelations with the king, whom they were connected only vassal oath.Possession of these great feudal ownership sometimes exceeded the king himself.In fact, King is more or less freely could only feel in our own domain -ancestral land holdings. The most telling example of this situation isFrance. Where royal domain stretches thin <span class="SpellE">strip</span>from Paris to Orleans, on all sides zazhatyy holdings of other feudal lords.In fact, the power in the country did not exist, and rela between feudal lords builtvasalitetu on the system. No control of state apparatus, the single tax,unified army and so did not exist. The boundaries of the conventional and were oftenchanged. Such a procedure called <b style="">feudal fragmentation</b>. Each in their feudal estates felthimself king. Kings were the only &quot;first among <span class="SpellE">equal &quot;</span>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">From a letter from King Henry (middle XI.)</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Every day new troubles. Nobody wants to think about the poor Franceanyone believes that <span class="SpellE">first time</span> all he needs to increasetheir possession. So again, Earl <span class="SpellE">Raul</span> stolen from <span class="SpellE">Verdun</span> Bishop 18 cows and does not want them to return. IKing was forced to comply with the request and sent a bishop to say <span class="SpellE">Raul</span>That is unacceptable to insult the church pastors, evendemanded that he returned the cattle. Graf said trustees are not afraid of noKing, nor the thunder of the church.

</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Which means the impact King had on their subjects during thedisintegration?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Somewhat different was the situation in the German (<span class="SpellE">East</span> Frankish) kingdom. German kingdom in thistime consisted of four tribal duchy - <span class="SpellE">Swabia</span>,Bavaria <span class="SpellE">Franconia</span> and Saxony. Here there was an electedmonarch: King was elected the higher nobility. Along with this a little force so-called&quot;Right of origin. The new king was to be a relative of the former, while historyGermany this principle is often violated. Capitals in the King was not.He ruled the state razezzhaya their estates. There was no nationaltaxes, the king lived primarily on the income from their estates. Authoritycame to the king immediately. Only when it came touse of military force or through skillful political alliances King couldearn a <span class="SpellE">tribute</span> Dukes. It Could not often.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This state of affairs could not last forever, societyneeded stability, and stability based on strong leadership. In thoseunder conditions of strong-man government understood the power of the monarch. EuropeanKings began the struggle for strengthening their power and unite their colonies.This struggle with varying degrees of success lasted several centuries and not alwayswas completed in favor of royal authority. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the beginning of this struggle the king was only a fewadvantages over all other feudal lords. He was on top of the feudal hierarchy andactually arbiter. The legality of its power provided by its constancytransmission by the dynastic principle, which was accompanied by the coronation ceremony andanointing of the kingdom, the awarding of royal characters, tumultuous welcome fromof the scrolls and vows to protect the Church, to ensure peace and justiceto administer justice. Important for the royal power was that someKings were canonized by the Church as holy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the struggle to assert its authority kings foundallies. These were cities that were interested in the development of handicrafts and trade,petty feudal lords, who suffered great persecution, the villagers and the church.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Backed by such powerful support in the XIII-XIV centuries.Kings considerably strengthened its authority. Especially this one in France.Kings began to issue national laws, taxes, King became a realhighest national judiciary. In appeared ramified state apparatus,which is usually not recruited for the distinction of origin, and for business properties.</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Chronicle</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">... nightmare of Henry and English</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But for completeness of the monarch neededconsiderable resources. Where monarchs failed to immediately seize the entire country, notgiving rivals consolidate (the Byzantine Empire, Sicily Kingdometc.), the monarch could not reckon with the interests of others. But usually monarchshad to engage in dialogue cities, leading social status. Itled to a new government - <span class="SpellE">birth</span>representative bodies (in different countries, they had different names) <b style="">Parliaments</b>And localgovernment. In some countries, these bodies were collected regularly andplayed an important role in the solution of the binding complex public issues, in addition to and notin favor of the King. But often these bodies became an obedient tool in the handsroyal power.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Living in Iceland is still proud that they formed &quot;the oldest parliament in <span class="SpellE">Europe</span>. This happened after the settlement of the island and DaneNorwegians. Settlers island divided into four parts. In each of the partshad its meeting to deal with all cases - <span class="SpellE">NADRA</span>. Foraddress common cases was 930 Althing was established - joint meetingrepresentatives of all four parts of the island. At the Althing adopted first incountry legislation that created the position of immigrants detector laws. He waspreserving the legal customs, never recorded. During the annual meetingAlthing he ascended to the law and told the Rock Assembly of laws andcustoms, which should sue Icelanders. Althing 1000 announcedIcelanders adoption of Christianity. </span></p>

<p class="a0"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Of course, it was not a real parliament, an elected body of government,that adopts laws, because the Icelanders at that time was not even the state, but itappearance - an interesting event in the history of European nations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So in Europe there <b style="">state ofmonarchy - a form of government in which King based its authority in consultation withground state of society through a class-representative bodies.</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Whether that time is always arise between peopledisputes that need solving. During this pre-state times caredtribal notables, the leader who brought out their decision, following the ancient unwrittenlaws. With the rise of the administration of justice is an important feature ofpower. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the conquest of the barbarians of the Western Roman Empire, theycontinued to maintain its common law and Roman population of Romanlaws. But this situation is not helped unite society. Already the firstKings try to create written laws, which would combine various rules of lawstrata of society, to eliminate those practices that are devastating for him (especiallyblood feud), and strengthen the power of rulers. The most famous such document is&quot;Salic <span class="SpellE">Pravda</span>. But at the lawyers of the Middle Agesnot stopped. They have created many laws. Especially rapid developmentacquired legal science in the XII century. for the second time when Europeans discovered a Romanlaw, which claimed: &quot;Justice - this constant desire to give and unremittinglyeach with their <span class="SpellE">rights &quot;</span>. Since medievalsociety shared on states, then <b style="">justiceit is.</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Church had a separate trial. Only farmers were judgedown superior.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another problem for the medieval jurists was thatthat there was a clear division of criminal law (crimes that pereymalosya)Civil (solution yazuvalo misunderstanding between people), etc., it added even moreconfusion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gradually, the supreme judicial power was fixed by kings,for royalty considered the only fair and judge had totrue and fair. But in reality it was much harder.In fact, King could not learn all court cases. Intended for considerationspecial judge. The courts of lower instance, like France, solution yazuvalycases to 60, for instance, higher - for serious crimes and penalties. What exceed 60 sou. ButKing could make a decision on any matter, may also be pardoned ifsentenced admitted his guilt. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Often between church and secular authorities there were conflictson the basis of justice. For a long time the church did not yield to their judicialrights, especially priests and jurisdiction in the area of family and marriage relations.</span></p>
