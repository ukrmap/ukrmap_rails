<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Interactionman and nature in the early Middle Ages</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Middle Ages life as in ancient dayscontinued to remain dependent on climatic conditions. Theydetermined by lifestyle, occupation and even the nature of man.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the early Middle Ages (V-th century.) When the climatecompared with ancient times was more humid and warm most of Europewas covered with forests. Even in Italy and Spain, where antiquity wasruined a lot of land, forests were more than fields. Among this sea of forestwere scattered in small settlements, which were joined to the piece of land thatprocessed for growing vegetables, legumes and cereals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the early Middle Ages were mostly lostfarming traditions of ancient times, because peasant farms usuallyget into the development of forest resources. Forest in those days was the main sourcelife and income. There vyhanyalysya graze herds of cattle. There, especially in oakforests fall recruited fat pig vidhodovuyuchys on an acorn. Thisfarmer receives for the winter stock guaranteed clear soft food. In the forest zahotovlyuvalysyafirewood for heating and vyhotovlyalosya charcoal, an important component forproduction of iron implements and weapons. Wood gave and building materials,For the stone at that time for construction was rare. Besides the forest was a place forcollection of various fruits and berries that have made poor food diversity in humanMiddle Ages. Especially important for those times was the honey of wild bees, includingthe fact that sugar is not known for a long time. In all kinds of resinous wood were collectedsubstances for making torches and lamps. Also zahotovlyuvalysya barkoak, without which it would be possible vychynyaty skins of animals. Ashes of burned shrubsbrush used for bleaching or dyeing fabrics. Moreover,woods and meadows collecting herbs - only those drugstimes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Important was the forest for hunting. All barbarians wereskillful hunters. To hunt in the forest was more suitable for the domesticated theythat, except dogs, falcons, ferret and even deer that vymanyuvaly their wildrelatives. Total forest gave everyday people the opportunity, even in the hungry yearssurvive. A famine at that time happened quite often.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wood was an important component for the wealthysociety. Most of the holdings of large landowners were exactlywoodlands. According to historians forest offered them a third of revenue. Exceptthat here they comfort themselves hunting.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Medieval Europe was inhabited by peoples of the former RomanisedRoman Empire, Greeks, Celts, Germans, Slavs, Thracians, <span class="SpellE">Balts</span>, Finno-Finns. The population can be setonly approximately. Scientists believe that after the collapse of the Roman Empirepopulation in Europe has declined.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What caused this decline? One reason historianssee Plague. This most terrible disease for the first time literally medievaldevastated Europe in the VI century. The epidemic lasted for half a century, and sometimesreduced the population by half. People perceived &quot;black death&quot; as a disasterapproximation of the Last Judgement. Salvation from the plague was not, except to flee from the sceneepidemic quickly, as far as possible to return later.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">How many people lived in Europe in the Middle Ages? This issue is quite complex,because nobody<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then did not hold censuspopulation in the modern sense. However, some rulers and feudal lords back in those daystrying to know how many subjects are and what they have in the lands toto find out how much they will collect taxes and then have the income.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The biggest disaster of the Middle Ages were <b>hunger, disease,epidemics and war</b>. Constant threat of hunger - a characteristicmedieval society. Insufficient development of technology led topoor harvests. The state of independent farmers - the majority of producersagricultural products - not prompted them to increase yields.Medieval Europe was constantly on the verge of starvation. Enough has been droughtprolonged rains or locust invasion and the level of the population fell sharply in manyregions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 14.2pt 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Those who perished from hunger, suffering from disease.Unfortunate food, poor food, lack of understanding of hygiene, lack ofbasic medical care did medieval people extremely vulnerable tovarious diseases. The highest mortality was from tuberculosis, malaria,leprosy, cholera, dysentery, typhoid. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Helpless and desperate people saw in them the divine punishment andsought assistance from the saints. And their in medieval Europe was over 20.It was believed that the pilgrimage and to touch their <span class="SpellE">Relics</span>cures the disease.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When the disease moved into the epidemic, theydevastated huge areas. Worst was the plague. Panic that sheraised in the medieval man at that time reflected the most commonprayer to God: &quot;From plague, famine and war, deliver us, O Lord!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Equally disastrous consequences had the war. ForMedieval Europe continuously suffered from predatory raids,aggressive and internecine wars, foreign invasions. War reduced or completelydestroyed the meager food supplies, argued to begging peopleweakening their ability to resist diseases and epidemics.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">All Rights medieval disasters led to whataverage life expectancy was 22 - 32 years.

But it is not evidencethat people in the Middle Ages were bezvylaznymy homebody, property are connected to theirplot of land surrounded by forest. Conversely, people in this period were very mobileand it can be argued that society all the time there were in motion. At first it iswere echoes of the Great Migrations. Later in the way people pushedhave other causes. Along the roads of Europe were moving villagers alone and in groups,looking for a better life; knight - in search of deeds and beautiful ladies, monks -moving from monastery to monastery, students who go to famous schools anduniversities, pilgrims and all kinds of beggars and vagrants. What pushed these people tolong and dangerous way? There were several reasons, among them can be identifiedfollowing:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Home</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">View homes depend on natural conditions, terrain, type ofemployment and living standards of its owner. Peasant houses almost unchanged fromancient times to the twentieth century. But the town houses, palaces and castles in mediumages have changed. Built houses, depending on the financial position andavailable materials, wood, stone or adobe did. Precious stonescost, so used mainly for construction of churches, palaces andlocks.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Joint housing for various social classesin the early Middle Ages was an internal planning. Most buildings are notwere individual rooms. People slept, ate and cooked in the same room. Only on XI- XIII. wealthy city dwellers and villagers have begun to separate from the bedroomkitchens and dining rooms. Many rooms appeared in the palaces and castles of Representativesnobility. However, all rooms located one after another, and toget from one part of the palace to another, had to go allpremises.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In most European peasant houses built of wood, onSouth, where this material does not suffice, provided the advantage of stone. Roofcovered with straw or reeds. In one room sleeping, cooked, ate.Heating and cooking facilities was carried out through openfire, which gradually replaced by the oven. When dissolved in fire, smoke coming out throughhole in the ceiling. Chimneys came later. The small window had no windows,they covered the wooden shuttered, skin or bladder. Cold season peasantFamilies often lived in the same building with livestock.</span></p>

<p class="a1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">All home furnishings consisted of crudely shot down the table, several benches along thewalls, boxes for storing holiday dress for years and it nazhyvalytransmitted by inheritance.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Middle man in your life did not havepossibilities remain in solitude. Proof of this was that time furniture.Bed and done really great and it is usually in addition to the hosts, restedas guests. It was considered a sign of hospitality. Canopy - a &quot;roof&quot; overbed - defended the rest of the insects were abundant in houses. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ordinary people mostly sleeping on benches or chests.Most furniture was simple and rough work. However wealthy orderedfurniture craftsmen carved, inlaid with precious metals and stones. Usualfor our cases did not exist - things were kept in chests. Cases Reachdrawers have spread from Italy, where they began making in the XII century.</span></p>

Daily meals wereRye bread, cereals, beans, turnips, cabbage, grain soup with garlic or onion.Meat eating enough. Moreover, within a year had 166 days of fasting, whenforbidden to eat meat dishes. Much more in the diet was fish. Ofsweets known only honey. Sugar was introduced to Europe from the East in the thirteenth century. andwas very expensive. Fruits and vegetables consumed very little.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The nature of the diet of the nobility and the poor differed,mainly consumed not quality, its quantity. In castles ate moremeat, and many were game, as hunting was considered a privilegenobility. Wealthy and liked to cook amazing dishes like roasted peacocks orswans or paste from nightingale reed. By eating oriental spices added -pepper, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon. However, their cost (selling spicesweight in gold) not everyone was affordable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In medieval Europe saw a lot: in the south - the wine, thenorth - beer. Instead zavaryuvaly tea herbs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tableware most Europeans - bowls, mugs - was verysimple, made of clay or tin. Items made of silver or goldenjoyed only know. No forks, spoons at the table eating. Roastscut with a knife and eat with your hands. Peasants ate food from a bowl with the family.Nobility at banquets put on two one bowl and cup for wine. Bones castunder the table and his hands wiping cloth.</span></p>

Unlike ancient praisebeauty of the human body, the church considered sinful flesh, and insisting thatit should cover the clothes. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For a long time women&#39;s and men&#39;s clothing was similar: long,knee-shirt, short pants, top shirt, coat. In the XII century. hestarted to increasingly differ, the first signs of fashion. Change Styleclothing of that time reflect social preferences. Men started wearing thickstockings, which in the XIV century. turned into trousers, women only imbibedskirts. However, the opportunity to follow fashion representatives were mainlywealthy. Church disapproved fashion elite capture.</span></p>

Most poor people Chagallrural roads or city streets in a mud wooden shoes or evenbarefoot. Headwear emerged in the XIII century. and from that time continuouslychanged. Usual gloves came in the middle ages important.Shake hands they considered an insult, and throw the gauntlet was an expression of someonecontempt and a challenge to fight.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nobility liked to add variety to your clothingJewelry. Men and women wore rings, bracelets, belts, chains. Veryoften these things were unique jewelry. For the poor it was allunattainable. And not only because of cost but also because it was prohibited by law.Significant funds spent on cosmetics affluent women and perfume, which brought witheastern merchants. They were jealous of representatives of the fair half of mankind whocould not afford such luxury, but tried to keep pace with fashion.</span></p>

Way of the wandering knight,pondering where to find a possession in which the war to participate and gainland. Farmers also began to condemn land, and to give our prohoduvatysyapart of their feudal lords. This forced the Europeans to start <b>colonization</b>- Development of new lands. <b>Sometimes active European colonization was the wholeperiod of XI - XIII centuries</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Middle Ages distinguish <b>military (external) andinternal colonization.</b> Military colonization was aimed at capturingnew lands by force of arms outside the spread of Western Christian civilization.Military colonization of the Europeans was aimed at the Iberian Peninsula, wherewas conducted fight with the Arabs and was called Reconquista (reconquer release), inPalestine <span class="SpellE">Where</span> carried out during the Crusadescause the release of the Holy Sepulcher, in the Baltic States, where the flag of anti-Pagans actually nyschylosya local population more. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Internalcolonization</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> -is developing an array of free land to farmers in Europe. At the time, freeareas in Europe is lacking. It was just a lot of work to makethat they gave yields and feed people. New farmers settled the land withgreat difficulties, but the threat of bad harvests and hunger pushed them to do so.They cut down forests, swamps osushuvaly and turned them into fertile fields. Thatprocess was very difficult, exhausting and time-consuming. Only a few generationspeasant family could change unsuitable for agricultureA fruitful area for Niva. Typically mastered extension of the land wasexisting fields.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Seniors support the efforts of the villagers, they understand:development of new land will bring population growth, because then more people willprohoduvatysya, maybe even have new villages, whose inhabitantsthey pay taxes and they are even more rich. Therefore feudalencouraged farmers to cultivation of virgin land, freeing them for some timetaxes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The need for land to the peasants even pushing on the offensivesea. Thus, residents of the Netherlands built a dam and gradually fought at seascraps of land, turning them into suburbs. Competitions and water rightsfloods lasted for centuries. Sometimes, during a sea storm flood drainedearth, but people restoring the dam, and again instead of the waves zelenilyOttawa.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To make such a grandiose attack on the natureThey needed new tools and various technical inventions. Most newimplements or methods of agriculture were not invented at a time whenEuropeans expand their living space (XI-XIII.), but considerablyearlier. However, at this time, they became widely available and playeddecisive role. For deforestation near the chopper began to use heavyax. For plowing new land was used heavy wheeled plow, inthrough which clamps and harness were to harness the horse. Clamp moved gravitate workfor a horse from the neck to the chest that did not contribute to the rapid exhaustion. A horseshoe-shaped ironfor the horse were protected against injury. For the cultivation of land becameuse heavy iron harrows. Thanks to the plow and harrow could developmore difficult, but fertile soils. An important element of rural landscape werewindmills, borrowed from the East. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Top of the XIV century. development of Europe vpovilnyvsya,and since 1316, when there was famine, even stopped. EconomyEurope has entered a strip of deep crisis, which she was able to overcome only a hundredyears. What, was caused by this crisis?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When growing population of Western Europe, respectively,increased demand for grain and other food products. To meet it,began to use the land of little value for crops growing, for essentiallyincrease yields on already used land did not know how. But evenlargest yields barely enough to feed all. Therefore, a small harvest andcold winter could lead to disaster. And ever more frequent crop failures: fromearly fourteenth century. in Europe have changed natural conditions - winter werecooler, fits more rain.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To escape from hunger, some farmers beganmove to the cities, hoping that by finding work, they can buyafford more food. But the large influx of labor and the father of the problem of unemploymentfall in earnings. In 1316 Europe has covered famine in the coming yearswas repeated. Famine led to serious consequences: decreasedfertility, decreased number of marriages, and epidemics spread revoltpoor segments of society. These troubles plague added that a fewyears spread throughout Europe. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In October, 1347</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to the port of Messina in Sicilyarrived ship. Sat at the oars men, whose bodies were covered with dark Blistersthat bleeding and hnoyilysya. Sailors tormented by pain, they died a fewdays after onset of signs of illness. Ship influx of Kafi, whose inhabitants fledthe city, surrounded by Mongols. Latest from the despair that can not take the city,thrown outside the walls of several dead bodies of plague. The city started the epidemic,and the inhabitants fled. They arrived in Sicily. With their ship got hererats that were with fleas peddle infection. So spread the epidemic,named <span style="">&quot;Black death&quot;</span>. Plaguemanifested in two forms: bubonic and pneumonic. The first passed throughbites of infected fleas, the second - through coughing or breathing impressed lungs. Secondform was terrible, because it died from all patients, while the first -80%. Since then struck Europe two active plague, the disease quicklymowed people and spread with lightning speed. In just three years the plague killed a quarterEuropean population - about 25<span class="SpellE">million</span> people. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The causes of this disaster, no one system did not know, butterrified people were ready to believe anything to find the culprit. And such&quot;Guilty&quot; were: Jews poisoned wells, to destroy Christians. Europe was hitJewish pogroms. Thus, in the town <span class="SpellE">Saint Veltene</span> wasJews burned alive in 2000. This attitude toward Jews explained thatmost of the population they perceived as wrong: They pray not becauseGod killed Christ, lead a different lifestyle and more. Escaping frompersecution, they fled to Poland and Lithuania, where the attitude to them was moretolerant.</span></p>

Living just enough to bury the dead, alive or turned away fromthem with disgust. A terrible fear seized all, and when someone appeared ulceror tumor?, then that person is not rendered any assistance, and relatives turned awayfrom it?
