It is on these grounds then faced GermanKingdom. But while those lands had to remind the state. They existedfive duchies, holders of which almost obeyed kings of the dynastyCarolingian. Notables families constantly fighting for power. This confrontation feudal lords,Dukes and kings often had armed character and therefore was called <b>internecinewars</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Together with the internecine wars of the earthEast Frankish kingdom suffered from attacks of the aliens. <span class="SpellE">Shidnofrankski</span> Kings and Dukes were able to protect localVikings from their lands. But at the end of X t. a new dangerousenemy, who came from the east, - Hungarians, or Magyars. After the relocation ofPryurallya in Europe these tribe of nomadic herdsmen settled on the plain in the middlecurrent of the Danube and began attacking neighboring states. The first invasion of Hungarydied Slavic state of Great Moravia. Hungarians then begandevastate German states that <b>Dukes urged to unite in a singlekingdom</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In 919, the localnobility proclaimed King of East Frankish kingdom Saxon DukeHenry Bird. In that event dates back story of the new European state- German kingdom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt; line-height: 12.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">Henry I increased the power and put an end to constant quarrels and disputesGerman nobility. To fight against the Hungarians and the protection he orderedbuild a small fortress - <span class="SpellE">Burg</span>. As in othercontemporary European countries, Germany was founded numerous heavy cavalry -knights. It is using it, the 955 son of Henry I <b>Otto I </b>(936 - 973years) inflicted such a crushing defeat of the Hungarians in the decisive battle on the river Lech inBavaria, they always stopped seizures.</span></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Unlike his father, Henry I, who after the election of the Kingrefused the coronation and anointing to the kingdom, his son, solemnlycrowned in <span class="SpellE">Aachen</span>, Strongly emphasized the advantageKing over all the notables. He believed himself to be the person who will restore RomeCharlemagne&#39;s empire, would like Charlemagne crowned in Rome andget the imperial title by the Pope.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">In 961, the Otto I madetrip to Italy, supported the 22-year old Pope John XII in the fight againstrecalcitrant vassals and turned his lost throne. February 2, the 962 inSt. Peter&#39;s in Rome grateful pope crowned Otto as Roman andemperor. <b>Since then, German king and Roman imperial crownare indivisible. So it was again restored to the Roman Empire in the West</b>.But it already had another empire borders and other historical circumstances.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-bottom: 2.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">At the coronation of Otto IJohn XII gave the document to verify that the Popepossess Pope area, emphasizing the dependence of this pope and churchemperor. But John XII thought its imperial power above, becauseit is from God, and the emperor, in turn, receives power from the pope. In the futureThese disputes led to violent struggle between empire and papacy.</span></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Confronting Church and imperial peaks reached a peak in the second halfArticle XI. When the pope was <b>Gregory VII</b> (1073 -1085), which held a series of reforms in the Catholic Church. Among them was the abolition and<b>investiture</b> - The right of the emperor or king clerics approve ofchurch office.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">It is this reformoutrage 26-year German emperor <b>Henry IV</b>(1056 - 1106) who did not want to lose its power over the bishops.Began a long and exhausting struggle. First Emperor gathered in <span class="SpellE">Worms</span> German bishops and got them to decidedeprivation of the rank of Gregory VII. Then the pope the bishops gathered in RomeFrance and Italy, excommunicated Henry IV and released himsubjects from the oath of the emperor. This advantage dissatisfied Henry IVGerman feudal lords and began an uprising against the emperor. This situationHenry IV left no alternative but to seek reconciliation with the papacy.Cold winter 1077 with little emperor came to the residence by postKanossa pope at the castle in northern Italy. Within three days Henry IVwas forced to stand barefoot in the clothes atoning sinner before the gates of the castle,Gregory VII pardoned until his opponent. Since the word &quot;Kanossa&quot;became the symbol of the spiritual conquest of the secular authorities, and the phrase &quot;walking inKanossu &quot;means the deep humiliation of the winner of the loser.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 12.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext;">But Henry IVforget the humiliation and not accepted. In 1084 He gathered a large army,went to Rome and conquered it. Gregory VII barely escaped from captivity andwas forced to flee to the south of Italy. The following year, Pope Gregory VII diedbequeathing to their successors to continue the struggle against the emperors.</span></p>

<p class="a2"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The struggle against papal authority led to a weakening of the German Empire.German nobility gained power and became the hereditary ruler of the land,of the Duchy and other secular and spiritual possessions grew considerably.After all, during the struggle between the emperors and popery both sides gave groundand a variety of benefits to supporters. The emperor remained the supremeseniors, but the nature of its power has changed. <b>German nobility fixed rightelect the emperor</b>. He could still choose to make life for his successorson, but still the principle of selectivity, rather than inheritance, was important.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The weakening of the empire marked the beginning of a newpolitical entity - the Swiss federation. In 1291 three communitiesAlpine Land (Canton) - <span class="SpellE">Schwyz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Uri</span> and <span class="SpellE">Unterwalden</span> - United to bringagainst attempts to subjugate them by Emperor Rudolf I Habsburg (1273-1291 biennium).The emperor and his successors sought to unite all its holdings in a single unit,and free peasants were in the way of him. Also through this land wasimportant pass <span class="SpellE">Gotharde</span>That bound Germany to Italy.According to a legend in the fight against Habsburg compatriots liftedknown bow William <span class="SpellE">Tell</span>. In 1315peasant infantry troops utterly defeated by the Habsburgs mountains <span class="SpellE">Morhanten</span>. After that, the union joined by fiveurban cantons. But it took a few more victories to the Union has achievedautonomy from the Empire (1499). Finally, international recognitionSwitzerland won independence only in 1648 Late fifteenth and earlySixteenth century. the union joined 5 other cantons. Population cantons spoke ondifferent languages - German, French, Italian, but they are united by a commondesire to live in a free country.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Long time, Union had no permanentauthorities. Cases of each Cantona resolved at a meeting of men andUnion general assembly in cantons. Each rim could conduct its owndomestic and foreign policy, but gave a promise that will not harm the commoninterests.</span></p>

Union became the largest cities <span class="SpellE"><b>Hanse</b></span>- Of merchant cities that were intermediary trade. Union wasbegan in 1241 when the city of Hamburg and <span class="SpellE">L</span>Allied made a contract. Finally, alliance formed in 1356It consisted of nearly 80 cities in North Germany, the Baltic and <span class="SpellE">nyzhnoreynskyh</span> lands.
