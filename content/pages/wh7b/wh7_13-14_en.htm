<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sum up</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Age of Great Migrations ruined ancientworld. One that survived was the Christian church. IV-V century. wereimportant for the Christian church. She made the Creed - importanttenets of Christian doctrine, rejecting all heretical.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The clergy was considered first as a medievalsociety. Because they performed work that was more important than any other earthlybusiness - cared about the salvation of souls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is therefore not taking into consideration costs of resources, effort and timeEuropeans built huge cathedrals and numerous churches, clergy yieldedtithe - a tenth of the harvest and other income. Wanting to save theirsoul, rich and poor gave their church property and land ownership. Evenmore, the society gave the church the most capable and educated children whodedicated life to serving God. The first condition was the only one that is replenished by immigrantswith different states of society. Almost all famous scientists and thinkers, and the substantialthe writers and poets, artists, musicians, belonged to the clergy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1054 once in a single Christian churchsplit, the eastern (Byzantine) Christianity separated from the western (Roman).Formed the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Catholic Church headed by PopeRome and the Orthodox Church had no single leader and was dependent onsecular government.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Christian Church in the West quickly realized it couldplay an independent role, with huge resources. Based on this, RomanPope&#39;s X - XIII. led the fight for unification of all Christianthe world under his rule. Gradually the church became the largest landownerin Europe, and the life of the church leadership is not something different from secularfeudal lords. The clergy was not limited in its activities onlychurch services and prayers. They carried out justice, participated inadministration of the state, performing feudal features taught in schools anduniversities, funded by the royal event. For many, prayer has becomeonly a secondary occupation.</span></p>
