<h3> Stars </h3><p class="rvps2"> stars - planetary bodies. Each star - a giant red-hot ball. The temperature at its surface is different. From the surface temperature depends on the color of the stars.</p><p class="rvps2"> Stars is a group called <i> constellations. </I> Back in ancient times people have given names for the constellation of their similarity to different subjects.

Its diameter - 1 million 392 thousand miles. Other stars in billions of times larger than the Sun, or much less of it.</p><p class="rvps2"> <br></p><h3> Solar System </h3><p class="rvps2"> temperature on the surface of the sun reaches 6 thousand degrees, and deep - to 15 million degrees. In this temperature all substances that make up the Sun, are in the hot gas. Because the sun constantly emits plenty of light and heat.</p><p class="rvps2"> sunlight and heat lit and warmed the planet, moving around the Sun.</p><p class="rvps2"> Planet does not emit light and heat. It is - cold planetary bodies. their lights and heats the sun.</p><p class="rvps2"> Planets seem bright stars. This is because they shine the reflected sun light.</p><p class="rvps2"> The way the planet moves around the Sun, called <i> orbit. </i></p><p class="rvps2"> Most are natural satellites of planets - planetary bodies. They move around the planets in their orbits. Earth has 1 satellite - the Moon, Mars - 2 in Jupiter - 16, and Saturn - 18 satellites.</p><p class="rvps2"> moving around the Sun as asteroids, comets and meteors.</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Sun and planetary bodies </i> - planets and their natural satellites, asteroids, comets, meteors, which move around the sun - the solar system formed <i>. </i></p>
