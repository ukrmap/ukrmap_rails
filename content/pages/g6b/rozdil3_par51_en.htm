Only plants are capableof photosynthesis from lifeless - inorganic chemicals to create living -organic, while highlighting oxygen. For this they called the &quot;oxygen factories.Animals can not themselves create organic matter, but to live without themcan. Because they feed on plants (herbivores) or eat each other(Predators). Animals inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, which is necessaryplants for photosynthesis. The remains of plants and animals have long covered the entire Earthlayer a few tens of meters, if not microscopic.
