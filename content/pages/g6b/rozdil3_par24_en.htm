It is well visible at physicalmap hemispheres. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Plainsare <i style="">flat</i><u>.</u> Their surfacelevel, there are no notable rises and descents. There <i style="">hilly plains</i>Where alternating with a lower increase. Butsuch disparities are high relative to 200 m. Thus, <i style="">plain</i> - A relatively level areaEarth&#39;s surface with small fluctuations heights. Most of the plains of the worldhuge in size. This is reflected in their names: <i>Great Plain of China</i>Eurasia <i>Great Plains</i> in North America. At one <i>Eastern Europeanplain</i> fit the territory of many countries - Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova,Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Russia (West). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Heightplains.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">By <span style="">height above sea level</span> amongdistinguish low plains (lowlands), elevated (height) and high(Plateau). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Lowlands</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> have absoluteheight to 200 m. For example, <i>West-Siberian plain</i> with flat surfacein Eurasia. At the Earth&#39;s surface is the lowlands, which are even below the levelSea. For example, <i>Pre-Caspian Sea lowland</i> lies 28 m below sea level.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Highlands</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> - It is plain fromheights from 200 to 500 m. The hills include, for example <i>Podolsk</i>in Ukraine.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Plateau</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> - It is alsoplain, just high enough - over 500 meters above sea level. Examples are <i>Serednosybirskeplateau</i> and plateau <i>Dean</i> in Asia. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">FlatUkraine establishes relief duty lowlands and highlands. With physical mapeasily identify where they are: yellowish color elevations Featuresamong the green, which indicates the lowlands. Yes <i>Dnieper</i> <i>height</i>located in western and <i>Black Sea Lowland</i> liessouth. However, in nature it is difficult to notice the transition from one type to the Plainsmore. If you go, for example, from Odessa to the winery, the area will graduallyincrease and a traveler invisible to continue its path is notLowland and Upland. Change in absolute height can be set only byusing special equipment. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Formationplains.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Plains can be formed as a result of lifting and removal of sea waterbottom. This occurs during the vertical movement of the crust. These plaincalled <i>primary</i>. For example, <i>Black Sea</i> <i>lowland</i>Farmland was once the bottom of the Black Sea.</span></p>

Some of them,created river sediments (sand, loam), which accumulated in a long timedecrease in the crust. Their surface is flat or <span class="SpellE">undulating</span>.Yes <i>Mesopotamian marshes</i> formed by sediments of the rivers Euphrates and Tiger.The plains may occur in place of mountains, when under the influence of external processesdestroyed their peaks and slopes and valleys filled with rubble. Then the mountainplace gradually and leveled into a hilly plain.An example is <i>Kazakh <span class="SpellE">dribnosopkovyk</span></i>- High plain, where the tower remains of some mountain ranges. InUkraine is so plain <i>Donets Ridge</i>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Plainsusually coated thickness of sedimentary rocks: sand, clay, lesamy, gravel,limestone. Lie deep beneath magmatic and metamorphic rocks: granitesand gneiss. In some places they come to the surface. Layers of sedimentary rockslying horizontally or with a slight incline. Determine which way inclinedplain and on the ground, and can map the direction of flow of rivers. </span></p>

Plains, asusually lie on the platform - the old stable areas aligned lithosphericplates. Therefore, internal processes, there appear to be mainly in the slowvertical movements. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Externalprocesses related to the work of water and wind. Where there is enough fluid waterformed river valleys, ravines. Yara destroy the area&#39;s fertile lands. To combatpeople impose on them bushes and trees. In the desert, where dry, the surface of the plainschanges due to weathering and the action of wind, creating a sand ridge,dunes and dunes. Today was a great external force and economic activityrights. During construction of the bridge, laying paths gully fall asleep, makeembankments. During mining operations have careers and near minesgrowing mounds of waste - <i style="">piles</i>.Unfortunately, often converting natural person has a negative surfaceconsequences. Nedbal economic activity can lead to densenetwork of ravines, the conversion of fertile land on the heath. </span></p>
