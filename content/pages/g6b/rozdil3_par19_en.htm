It is to determine the age of rocks by the remnants of various organismsliving in the past. Their remains are in the majority of sedimentary rocks. When organismsdie off, the soft parts of their bodies are destroyed without a trace. However, the solid parts(Shell, shell, bone), are buried in sediment accumulation over timekam&#39;yaniyut and well maintained. Thus, in continental sediments are the remainsdinosaurs, birds and plants. In marine sediments many remnants of molluscs.We know that first appeared on Earth simplest organisms. In billionsyears they have changed and evolved. Thus, the remains of primitive plants and animalsoccur in the oldest layers of sedimentary rocks, and the most developed - inmost recent sediments.
