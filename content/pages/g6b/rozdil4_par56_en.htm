<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The population of our planet continuouslyincreases. In the distant past, before our era and the beginning of our own, itgrew slowly. The reason is that people strongly dependent on naturalconditions, it was hard to deal with epidemics and famine. The rapid growth ofpopulation began only in the last 400 years, when the dependence of humanNature has become smaller. By 1900 the population reached 1, 6 <span class="SpellE">billion</span> people. And of the twentieth century. population growthhave exploded: in 1975 - 4 <span class="SpellE">billion</span> man in 1987- 5 <span class="SpellE">billion</span> man in 1999 is 6 billionresident. The main reason for this rapid increase in population wasreducing mortality due to development of technology and medicine. Even inless developed countries could overcome many diseases that took one thousandlives. </span></p>

So, ifEarth&#39;s population is approximately 6 <span class="SpellE">billion</span>people and land area - 149 <span class="SpellE">million</span> km<sup>2</sup>Thenpopulation density on the planet will be 40 people per 1 km<sup>2</sup>.
