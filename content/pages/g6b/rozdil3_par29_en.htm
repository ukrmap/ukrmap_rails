Obviously, at noon when the sun is highest above the horizon,surface is heated most strongly. However, the highest temperaturenot observed at 12 th and at 14-15 hours. This is because the transmissionheat from the earth&#39;s surface air takes time. In the afternoon, despitethat the sun was falling toward the horizon, the air continues to heatyet within two hours of heated surface.

The shorter the shadow, the sun above the horizon andgreater angle to the Earth&#39;s surface its rays.
