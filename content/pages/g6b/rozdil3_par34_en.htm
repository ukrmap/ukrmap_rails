Provein air and water, quite easily. Just think of the freezerrefrigerator. Where it took snow and ice, since there is no water poured?They were formed from water that &quot;has gone&quot; back to the air. In an atmosphere of water vaporcomes as a result of evaporation from the surface of oceans, rivers, lakes, <span class="SpellE">Soil</span> et al.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">But evaporative air can not holdvapor infinite. This limit depends on its temperature. From Fig.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>shows that the higher the temperature the morepair may be contained in 1 m<sup>3</sup> air. For example, 1 m<sup>3 </sup>airat 20<sup>0</sup> С<span style="">&nbsp; </span>may containany number of couples, but not more than 17 grams of water. If the air is absorbedmaximum for a given temperature of the steam, it&#39;s called <i style="">saturated</i>. Often air is <i style="">unsaturated</i>Ie it contains waterpair less than they might have. For example, over the steppes and deserts are always dry air,unsaturated, because there is little evaporation.</span></p>

For example, say: absolutehumidity is 15 g / m<sup>3</sup>This means that 1 m<sup>3 </sup>aircontained 15 g of steam. World&#39;s most absolute humidity in Antarctica- One hundredth of fate g / m<sup>3</sup>, The largest at the equator - 23 g / m<sup>3</sup>.Lowest in Ukraine in January - about 3 g / m<sup>3</sup>.</span></span></p>

Thus, ifin air containing 3 g / m<sup>3</sup> couples, but for most of this temperatureits possible content of 5 g / m<sup>3</sup>, The relative humiditybe 3: 5 x 100% = 60%. This means that air contains only 60% of themore water vapor that it could accommodate at this temperature.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Relative humidity is always high (85%) inequatorial latitudes. This is because there all year round high temperatures and largeevaporation from the surface. Similarly, high relative humidity andpolar areas, but due to low temperature (for cold saturationair does not need much moisture). In temperate latitudes the relative humiditywinter is higher than in summer. For example, in Ukraine in winter is higher than 80%, andsummer decreases to 60-70%. Especially low relative humidity in the desert -50% and below. Air humidity is 30%, considered very dry. </span></p>
