But the sunlight heats onlysurface layer of water. His temperature in different parts of Ocean Divers.Surface water temperature of water depends on climate and decreases fromequator to the poles. The highest temperature of 25? 27 <sup>0</sup>C - inequatorial and tropical latitudes of the hot climate. The lowest (-1.8 <sup>0</sup>C)- In the polar regions with cold climates. </span></p>

The average temperature is the whole mass of oceanicwater is only 4 <sup>0</sup>Warm water S. concentrated in relatively thinsurface layer approximately 100 m thickness.

It depends on the evaporation of water fromsurface ocean and arrival in his fresh water rivers and from atmosphericprecipitation. Therefore, salinity changes from the equator to the poles. In tropicallatitudes salinity largest - 38 ‰, because there is little rain, andgreat evaporation. When evaporation of salt water in the sea remains. Inequatorial latitudes lower salinity (34 ‰) - there is heavy rainfall. In polarareas of reduced salinity to 32 ‰. Precipitation there falls a little, butslight evaporation. Salinity is reduced and as a result of melting ice.</span></p>
