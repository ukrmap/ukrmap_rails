<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">The emergence of geography</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> In the old dayspeople could not explain the phenomena of nature, much more - the links between them. Theycould not understand how a light and strong wind, thunder roars and whyshining lightning why sometimes rise in the sea giant waves and the earthshaking earthquakes, why plants grow and wither. To explain thesephenomenon of people come up with various gods. Each of them knew his &quot;kingdom&quot;: airforests, rivers, seas. Mother of all gods who gave birth to the sky, the sea and mountains,Ancient Greeks considered the goddess of the Earth - Gaia. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Exactlybecause the ancient Greek scholar <span class="SpellE"><b><i>Eratosthenes</i></b></span><b><i>
</i></b>even in the third century. BC Starting to study the Earth, called histraining - Geography. In this speech, he combined the name of the goddess of the Earth with the word &quot;<span class="SpellE">graph</span>&quot;- Write. So, the word &quot;geography&quot; can be translated as&quot;<span class="SpellE">zemleopys</span>. Since the study of the Earth or its partsbecame known as geography. So consider the geography of ancient doctrines,because it appeared more than 2 500 years ago.</span></p>

It seeks answersthe question &quot;where?&quot; and &quot;why&quot; (ie, why the phenomenon occurs where theythere?). Geography also reveals the links between human world and the worldNature. It explains how to make better use of natural wealth, what to dothat nature is impoverished, that forests have not disappeared, not zmilily rivers have lost fertilitysoils.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">ModernGeography rozhaluzylasya and turned on the system sciences.
