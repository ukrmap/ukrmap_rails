<i style="">Swamp</i> - Is excessively wetland surface. Water is not flowing, and stagnates. The bog growhygrophilous plants. It formed peat - napivrozkladenyh thickness of tailingsplants. </span></p>

First, settle on the lake sand, clay,silt brought by rivers and streams. Nahromadzhuyuchys at the bottom, they graduallyfill the lake basin. Milli Lake and its dimensions are reduced. Agroundgrow cane, reed mace, sedge. Subsequently, the plants spread to almost all of the lake.When they die, their remains deposited on the bottom. Over time, theypiled up, compressed and converted into peat. So in place of the lakethere is the mire (Fig.). Another way of formation of marshes - wetlandsland with shallow groundwater occurrence. </span></p>

Bogs accumulate moisture and themaintain water levels in lakes, ponds and wells. Bogs - complex naturallaboratory, natural filters. From the marshes of muddy water from a liquidclean and gives the creeks and rivers. Bogs reduce drought in the contiguousarea. They are a unique haven for wetland plants and animals. There are growingberries and medicinal plants, live animals valuable fur - beaver, muskrat,nutria, hundreds of nesting birds. In the marshes formed a valuable benefitresources - peat, which has many uses. First, it is used asfuel. By chemical processing of peat produced fertilizers, dyes,cellulose and even medicines. </span></p>

Therefore, drainage of wetlands andtheir use of agricultural crops in the cult is not always justified.</span></p>
