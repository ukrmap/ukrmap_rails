<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Conceptabout atmospheric pressure.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> Air is an invisible and easy. However, it also, like everysubstance that has mass and weight. So it puts pressure on the earth surface and allbody that it is. This pressure is determined by weight of air columnheight of the whole atmosphere - from the earth&#39;s surface to its upper limit itself.Established that such a pillar of air pressure per 1 cm<sup>2</sup> surfaceforce of 1 kg 33 kg (under 1 m<sup>2</sup> - Over 10 tons!). Thus, <i style="">atmospheric pressure</i> - A force with whichair pressure on Earth&#39;s surface and all the items on it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The surface of the human body averages 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>.Under air pressure on her weight was 15 tons Such pressure can crushall living things. Why do we not feel? This is due to the fact that withinhuman body as a pressure - internal and it is atmospheric.If this balance is disturbed, the person feels bad.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Measurementatmospheric pressure.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> Pressure is measured byspecial device - the barometer. Translated from the Greek word means&quot;Gravity meter. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">At the weather station used <i style="">mercury barometer</i>. The main part of it - a long glass tubem, sealed at one end. She loaded mercury - a heavy liquid metal. Openend of the tube immersed in a wide bowl, also filled with mercury. In a rollovermercury from the tube resulted only to a certain level and stop. Why is itstopped, turned and not all? Because the air puts pressure on the mercury in the bowl andproduces all of its tube. If the atmospheric pressure decreases, the mercury in the tubefalls and vice versa. For high column of mercury in the tube, which marked scaledetermine the amount of atmospheric pressure in mm. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">In parallel 45<sup>0 </sup>at sea level attemperature 0 <sup>0</sup>C in air pressure mercury columnin the tube rises to a height of 760 mm. This air pressure is <i style="">normal atmospheric pressure</i>. Ifcolumn of mercury in the tube rises above 760 mm, the pressure <i style="">increased</i>Below - <i style="">reduced</i>.Thus, the pressure of the atmosphere of the whole air column urivnovazhuyetsya weight column of mercuryheight 760 mm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">In the campaigns and expeditions using more convenientdevice - <i style="">aneroid barometer</i>.&quot;Aneroid&quot; in Greek means &quot;<span class="SpellE">bezridynnyy</span>:There was no mercury. The main part of it is metallic elastic capsule from whichdownloaded air. This makes it very sensitive to changes in external pressure. Atelevated pressure is compressed to a lower - is expanding. These fluctuationstransmitted through a special mechanism arrow that indicates the scale valueatmospheric pressure in millimeters of mercury.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Dependencepressure from the ground elevation and air temperature.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> Pressure depends on the height area. The higher the level ofsea, the air pressure is less. It decreases because of reduced liftingheight of air column that presses on the earth&#39;s surface. In addition, high pressurefalls also because it decreases the density of the air itself. At an altitude of 5 kmatmospheric pressure is reduced by half compared with the normal pressure atSea. In the troposphere on a show for every 100 m pressure decreases by about 10mm <span class="SpellE">рт</span>. Art. <i></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Knowing how the pressure can be calculated andabsolute and relative height of location. There is a special barometer - <i style="">altimeter</i>, Which together with the scaleatmospheric pressure, is and scale heights. So for each area willcharacteristic of its normal pressure: at sea level - 760 mm <span class="SpellE">рт</span>.Art. in the mountains, depending on height - below. For example, in Kyiv, which isat altitudes of 140-200 m above sea level, the normal average pressure is 746 mm <span class="SpellE">рт</span>. Art. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Pressure depends on air temperature.When heated air volume increases, it becomes less dense and easier.Because of this reduced and atmospheric pressure. When cooled place backphenomenon. However, as changes in temperature and pressure changes continuously.Throughout the day he rises twice (morning and evening) and double-declining(After noon and after midnight). In winter when the air is cold and heavy, the pressurehigher<span style="">&nbsp; </span>than in summer when it is warmerand easy. Thus, the change of pressure can predict weather changes. Decompressionindicates precipitation, increase - in dry weather. Atmospheric pressure affectsand wellbeing of people.</span></p>

Their formation is connected with heating andmoving air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Air above the equator well warmed up.

Above the poles, where low temperatures throughout the year, aircools, it becomes more dense and difficult. It therefore falls -is <u>downward movement </u>air - and increased pressure.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Thus, there is a close dependence of atmosphericpressure on the distribution of heat and air temperatures on Earth when ascending anddescending air movements cause uneven heating of the earth&#39;s surface.</span></p>
