Nabihayut it ashore, then vidkochuyutsya wave. Waterwaves does not move in horizontal direction. This is easy to verifywatching the float on the water. With the approaching waves it rises to itscrest and then falls on its sole (Fig.). It does not floatclose to shore and away from it. He just swinging atWaves: up-down. This indicates that water makes waves in verticalmovements, called <i style="">vibrational</i>. Movementwater in waves is comparable to the wheat field, which worried the wind.

It seems vdavlyuye water surface and displaysher off balance. Even a gentle breeze creates waves. Typically, wave height isexceeding 4 m. The highest waves over 20 m caused by storm winds.The largest of wind waves height of 34 m (a height of 10-storey building)was seen in the central part of the Pacific Ocean in 1933 when the wind is made weak,high waves rippling change - low anxiety. The stronger andwind longer and more water space, the higher the waves. With the depthanxiety is reduced and becomes noticeable. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Wavesperform destructive and creative work. In some places they are hitting with power at shoreshattering rocks, which he made. On the banks of the Black Sea powershock wave can reach 25 tons per 1 m<sup>2</sup>. Not every building will standsuch pressure. This water rises up to a height of 60 m. Duringstorm waves are able to move stones weighing several tons. To protectcoasts and port facilities from destruction, build breakwaters with specialreinforced concrete slabs. Creative work of waves - the crushed particles and delaya sandy and pebbly beaches. In addition, the wave mixing watercontribute to enriching it with oxygen and heat. It promotes life of organisms inOcean. </span></p>
