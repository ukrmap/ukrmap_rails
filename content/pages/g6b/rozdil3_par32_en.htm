<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Formationwind.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">
<span style="">Although air and invisible to the eye, wealways feel his movement - wind. The main cause of wind isdifference in atmospheric pressure over the area of surface. It is only pressurewhere a decrease or increase, as the air will travel from place to morepressure toward smaller. A pressure balance is disturbed uneven heatingdifferent parts of the earth&#39;s surface from which the different heating and air.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Try to imagine this in the examplewind that occurs on coasts and seas is called </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">breeze</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">. Lots of land surface - dry land and water - heated unequally.Sukhodil heats up faster. Therefore, the air above it heats up quickly. Itrise up, the pressure decreases. Over the sea at this time and colder airunder higher pressure. Because air moves from the sea on dry land in placewarm. That wind blew - <i style="">daily breeze</i>.At night everything is the opposite: dry land cools faster than water. Over itcold air creates more pressure. And over the water that lingers long and warmcooled slowly, the pressure will be lower. Colder air from the land ofhigh pressure area moves towards the sea where the pressure is less. There <i style="">Night Breeze</i>. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Thus, the difference in atmospheric pressure acts as a force thatcauses horizontal movement of air from high pressure region to the lowpressure. So wind is born. </span></p>

For example, if the wind is blowing fromevent, it is called Western. This means that air moves from westto the east. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Wind speed depends on atmospheric pressure: thegreater difference in pressure between areas of the earth surface, the stronger the wind. Itmeasured in meters per second. Near Earth&#39;s surface winds often blow from thespeed 4.8 m / sec. In the old days, when there were no devices, speed and strengthdetermined by local wind characteristics: at sea - by the action of wind on the water and sailvessels on land - on the tops of trees, a deviation from the smoke pipe. In manyfeatures was developed 12-point scale. It allows you to determine the strength of the windpoints and then his speed.
