</span>the ability to provide plant nutrients. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Soilformed as a result of complex interactions of rocks, climate,surface water, plants and animals. Rocks are the basis for formingsoil and determine its composition. Climate determines the presence of heat and itmoisture. Many animals that live in soil - worms, beetles, ants and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>animals (moles) - weeds and improvepenetration of water in it and air. And organisms decompose plant remainsand form humus (humus). It is in humus contains substances essential forpower plants. Because of its amount depends on soil fertility: the greaterhumus layer, the rodyuchishyy soil, thus increasing the yield of agriculturalcultures.<i> </i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Soilformed centuries. With dense vegetation and under favorableclimatic conditions for the soil layer 1-2 cm thick takes approximately500 years. To imagine the complexity of this process can provide such a simplifiedground formula: (rocks humus water air) x time = soil. Lowhy call a special natural soil formation.</span></p>
