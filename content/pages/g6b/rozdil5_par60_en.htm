<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Recall, in which groups share the mineralsfor commercial purposes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Completeand inexhaustible natural resources.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> The development of human society in allever been associated with various natural resources. Wealthnature that a person uses in economic activity, callednatural resources. Today, people use a huge amount of naturalresources. This is primarily water, which is an integral part of her life. Plants aresource of wood and food products. Deep Earth containing minerals,indispensable for development <span style="">noindustries. </span>All natural resources are divided into two groups:comprehensive and inexhaustible. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Using<i style="">exhaustible natural resources</i>leads to reduction or complete disappearance. Renewable resources can berecovery and irreparable. <i style="">RenewableResources</i> samovidnovlyuvatysya able in a relatively short time. Theseinclude water, soil, vegetation, fauna. For example, soil canslowly recover their fertility. However, excessive use of renewableresources can lead to loss of their ability samovidnovnoyi. It firstapplies to all flora and fauna. Yes, gone forever wild ox -tour. But now endangered bison appeared. Scientists had to makemuch effort to save him. <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Extraction</span></i></span><i style=""><span style="">Resources </span></i><span style="">- Is such a comprehensiveresources are not able to heal itself. These include minerals:oil, gas, coal, ore and non-metallic minerals. Minerals notrestored, such as forest after felling. Their reserves in the groundlimited. And updating is practically impossible, because the formation of mineralsoccurs over millions of years. This requires Berezhny and their economicaluse.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">To <i style="">inexhaustibleNatural Resources</i> include solar energy, wind power, <span class="SpellE">vnutrishnozemne</span> heat energy of tides. They consideredinexhaustible because their use does not reduce inventories.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Problemcompleteness.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Shortage of natural resources will soon bear the problem of lack of usefulresources. Mineral deposits in the world produced a huge amount.Deposits of coal, iron, copper, zinc and other metals accumulated by naturefor millions of years, used for decades. And yet the need for themgrowing. Thus, there may come a time when vysnazhatsya oil fieldcoal, ores of various metals. According to the stocks currently known specialistsoil in the world may be enough for about 50 years, and coal - 500.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">To the future and have the natural resources, they mustextract carefully and sparingly used. Now Possibilitiesreuse of resources, ie use of industrial and householdwaste.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Population and environment.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> Now scalehuman use of natural resources are very large. <span style="">With each century along with the increase of population impact on natureincreasing. In our time it has acquired such huge proportions that has become noticeablenot only in some places, but generally on the Earth. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Usingnatural resources, the person creates a substance that has never been in a geographicalshell. It interferes with the natural <span class="SpellE">circuit</span>.For example, burning huge amount of carbon dioxide increases contentsdioxide in the atmosphere. But due to irrigation of deserts, creating reservoirs,use of groundwater water cycle is changing. Thus, geographicalshell - it is also a region of interaction of nature and society. Inside itHuman activities was the main factor of development. Therefore mankind inpresently responsible for the further development of the planet. <span style="">So each Earthman be aware thatgeographical cover - it is our habitat. From the air, water, forests,seas, useful</span> signing. With its vulnerability to predatoryextermination and earthly beauty. The future of this unique shell, we want itor not, affects us all</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Studyinggeography, you see that it not only scientific<span style="">&nbsp; </span>industry. Geography was part of the culture.Man you need a solid cultural understanding: the fate of humanity and nature are united.Land here is only one, we also residents of the planet, unique. Such understandingbased on knowledge of the geographical integrity of the shell, the relationshipall its components. </span></p>
