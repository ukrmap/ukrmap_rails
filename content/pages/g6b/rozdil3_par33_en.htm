<span style="">Scientists find that air troposphereis changing with height. It takes different properties depending onaddition, over which the surface is. For example, over the equator and hot airwet. Above the Arctic ice and snow it is cold, dry and transparent. Overthermal waters of the Atlantic Ocean it is warm and wet and hot overdeserts in the summer - dry, hot, dusty. As a result, the entire tropospherethough some are moving parts - <i style="">Airmass</i> with different properties: temperature, humidity, dust. Bysizes are huge - the size of a part of the ocean or continent. Theymoved in different directions collide, replacing one another.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Thus, in various parts of the world air mass canbe warm or cold, wet or dry, dusty or transparent.Such properties of the air becomes, if a long time is over a certainsurface. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Consider, as a born air masses as theymove, change and cease to exist.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Depending on the district formation distinguish </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">equatorial,tropical, moderate (in both hemispheres) and Arctic (Antarctic) </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">air masses. By their names easily identified by their properties. Overmoderates dominate the territory of Ukraine, but come and arctic and tropicalair masses.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">If the air mass formed over the ocean, itwill be different from that formed over the continent. Summer ocean waterColder than dry and warmer in winter. Therefore, maritime air mass in summer -cold in winter - heat in comparison with continental air. Airweight than equatorial, may be <i style="">wet(Sea)</i>And <i style="">dry(Continental)</i>. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Thus, the cause of various airmasses is uneven heating of the earth&#39;s surface by the sun and its various properties indifferent heat zones. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Movingand changing air masses.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> Air masses formedinevitably begin to move. You already know that the cause of their movement isuneven heating of the surface and, consequently, the difference in atmospheric pressure.Moving air masses is the main cause rapid changes in weather. This is it hotsunny weather in summer can suddenly change to cold and rainy in winterbring a thaw after heavy frost. When it&#39;s cool, talk aboutcoming of the cold air mass. A warming mean the arrival of warm airmass.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Air masses retain their properties longtime. However, moving further and further all over the earth&#39;s surface, they change:lose or replenish moisture or heat. Thus, moderate maritime moist air,moving over land gradually heated and dried, becomingcontinental. </span></p>
