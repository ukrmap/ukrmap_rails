Atmospheric air penetrates into the water androcks. water evaporates into the air and seeps into the Earth&#39;s crust.Small particles of species find themselves in the atmosphere and water.

This &quot;geographic portrait&quot; is a <i style="">geographic shell</i>Coveringlower atmosphere, the upper part of the lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere all.The main components - components - geographical environments are the rocks andminerals, air, water, soils, plants and animals.

After the withering away of the remains of plants andanimals decomposed by bacteria to inorganic substances, including other plantswill create organic.
