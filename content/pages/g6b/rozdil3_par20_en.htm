Its advancedin 1912 German scientist <i>Alfred <span class="SpellE">Wegener</span></i>.He suggested that the millions of years ago on earth there was a giant continent<i>
<span class="SpellE">Pangaea</span> </i>(Land only). He was surrounded by a singleOcean, which absorbed all the water. Over time <span class="SpellE">supermateryk</span>split into <span class="SpellE"><i>Lavraziyu</i></span><i> </i>і<i> <span class="SpellE">Gondwana</span></i>. Later they were also dividedcracks, breaks, and broken up into separate mainland depth. Away(Drifting), these fragments <span class="SpellE">Pangaea</span> become modernmainland, and between them formed ocean basin. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">ButA. <span class="SpellE">Wegener</span> failed to explain how the move couldcontinents. Subsequently, scientists have concluded that the lithosphere can not be solid assuch as shell eggs. It is comprised of separate blocks - <i style="">lithospheric plates</i> thickness from 60 to 100 km. They are dividedfaults, but like a giant mosaic, exposed backinganother. Plates are on the viscous, plastic surface Asthenosphere. Sliding inthere, they moved very slowly, as if flying at different speeds. </span></p>

They arise during radioactive decay and displacementmolten materials in the upper mantle. The internal forces are pushing lithosphericplates, and they move along the faults. There are slow and horizontalvertical movements of the crust.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Mostthere are considerable <i style="">horizontal movements</i>lithospheric plates. Moving, plates can converge, or rozsuvatysyamove relative to each other. When the slabs <u>converging</u>Then duringclash in their countries zmynayutsya folds formed on the surface of the mountain.For example, at the junction of plates <i>Indo-Australian</i> and <i>Eurasia </i>haveHimalaya mountains. If facing the mainland and oceanic plates, the ocean thathas a higher density, sinking under the mainland. Then on the mainland as wellthere are mountains and along the coast - deep depressions (troughs). For example,at the junction<i> plates <span class="SpellE">Nazca</span> </i><span style="">і<i> South American </i></span>any Peruvian Andes mountains andChilean and deep troughs. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Ifplates <u>sliding</u>Then formed faults. Most faults occuron the ocean floor, where the crust is thinner. Molten mantle substance breaksrises from the depths. It rozshtovhuye edges of plates, poured and solidifies,filling the space between them. It breaks in places on the ocean floor islengthening of the crust. It created new areas of the earth&#39;s crust asvalopodibnyh raising giant, called the Mid-oceanridges. For example, rozsuvanni <i>South American</i> and <i>Africaplates</i> at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean formed <span class="SpellE"><i>The North</i></span><i>Mid-ocean ridge.</i> Thus, under the ocean crust continuouslyupdated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Internalforces of the Earth and cause <i style="">vertical movements:</i>slow raising and lowering some portions of the crust. For example, Northpart <i>Scandinavia</i> rises to 1 cm per year, and the searetreats. These are the layers of sand and clay with remains of marine organismsoccurring at an altitude of 150 m above sea level. Thus, this area oncewas his bottom, and then rose to such heights. At the same time coast <i>Netherlands</i>For several centuries, falls at 3 mm per year and the North Seaoccurs on land. Residents forced to defend the lived-in land, building high(25 m) dykes and dams along the coast. Some areas in the country alreadylocated below sea level. In Ukraine, the largest rise recorded in the east<i>Kirovohrad</i> and north <i>Zhytomyr</i> <i>areas</i> - Almost 9mm / year. At the same time the Black Sea area <i>Odessa</i> fallsat speeds of almost 1 cm / year. Vertical movements are taking place very slowly, butconstantly and everywhere. They cover vast areas and are accompanied byindented or sea attack. Rising land changes over time and loweringvice versa. Because vertical motions are called <u>oscillating movements</u> the crust.These movements take place very slowly - from 2 to 10 cm per year. They are invisiblefor humans. Failed to detect them through the comparison of satellite images takenof artificial satellites. </span></p>
