They are causing the Earth&#39;s internal forces that are moving lithospheric plates. Theseforces cause discontinuities deep crust. In the immediate area of the gap shiftscrust. For several seconds inside the rock shifted a fewcentimeters or even meters in horizontal and vertical directions. Itgenerates a sudden earthquake. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Placeat depths where there is a gap and shift the earth&#39;s crust, called <i style="">center of the earthquake.</i> It canlocated at various depths - from several tens to 700 km. Ofdepth depends on the power of shaking the earth&#39;s surface: the deeper, the weaker. Ofcell in all directions apply powerful <i style="">seismicwave</i>. It can be likened to waves from a stone thrown into water. Seismicwave oscillations of the earth&#39;s solid passes over long distances. It is throughrecoil species in the depths and zavalyuyutsya buildings on the surface. Distributedfluctuations rocks very quickly - up to 7 km / sec.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Overcenter of the Earth&#39;s surface is <i style="">epicenterearthquake</i> (From the Greek &quot;<span class="SpellE">Epi</span>&quot;- Above). In the midst ofstrength of the strongest aftershocks. Off from him, it decreases. Seismicwave covers a huge area. For example, in 1977 when the earthquake occurredepicenter in <i>Carpathians</i>, Then far away in Moscow, in homespohytuvalysya chandeliers.
