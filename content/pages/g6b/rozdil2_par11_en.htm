<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Concepton a scale.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The distances on the ground pointing in meters or kilometers. For example, the distancefrom your home to school distance of 400 m. This paper can not be displayed.Therefore, plans or maps the distance given in a reduced size - in inches andmillimeters. To convert large distances in small areas on the plan,use the scale. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Scale</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> - A measure ofreduce distances in areas of the picture on the plan or map. In otherwords, the scale indicates how many times in the distance on the ground reduced topaper. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Whatlarger scale, the greater the reduction. The larger reduction in the moreits area can be represented. But the more reduction, the smaller andbecome less distinct objects on the plan or map. Thus, the larger the scale,so it is smaller.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Typesscale.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The scale can be written as fractional numbers, such as - 1: 10 000.Scale, expressed as fraction, called <i style="">numerical</i>.Number 1 (numerator) - is the distance on the plan, which corresponds to 10 000(Denominator) of such distances on the ground (ie, 1 cm on the plan = 10 000 cmareas). In the numerical scale, in the numerator is always unity. And the denominatorcan be any number that shows how many times the distance in terms of lowerthan on the ground. It is important to remember that the numerical scale of both figuresalways given in inches. For convenient numerical scale to determine how muchtimes the short distance on the plan.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Oftenalong with a numerical scale write his explanation. For example, in 1 100 m sm (10000 cm for easy transfer in meters). This also means that onecentimeter on the plan meets the 100 meters on the ground. Scale, recorded<span style="">&nbsp; </span>words, called <i style="">named</i>. Distance on the ground, which corresponds to 1 cm on the plancalled the largest scale. With the magnitude scale is more convenient to definedistance. For example, as long as the school garden, if its length on the plan - 3cm and the size scale - 100 m? It is easy to calculate that the garden has a length of 300 m (3 x100 m = 300 m). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Asconvert a numeric scale for named? Let there be a numerical scale 1: 25 000.To rename it will transfer 25 000 cm in feet (25 000 cm = 250 m). Thus,named scale - 1 cm in 250 meters </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Onplans also contain <i style="">linear scale</i>.It portrayed as a straight line, which is divided into equal parts (usuallycentimeters). Near the point value of each line nadpysuyut Accordingly, scale,distance on the ground (100, 200, 300 m ...). At the same zero set,departing at 1 cm from the left edge segment. A first centimeter divided intomillimeters (which mean respectively 10, 20, 30 m. .. on the ground). Byusing the linear scale can quickly and easily measure distances and determinesizes of objects in terms of using the compass-meter. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Measurementdistances on the plan.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The distance between two objects on the plan in a straight line measured normalruler. You can also use a compass-meter. To do this, placing thearm at the extreme point of the segment being measured (eg, from village tostation). Then, without changing the position of the legs compasses, put it on the linescale. Signs on the line immediately will say what is the distance to the terrain. Ifcompasses swing legs does not match a whole number of centimeters on a linearscale, the compass displace left behind the line so his right legwas on the whole podiltsi. Then will be seen not only centimeters, but the number ofmillimeters in the band, which specify the distance. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Sometimesthat the plan or map, not a direct measure distance and distance inin broken, curved lines (eg, long meandering stream). Then we canuse regular thread. Threads to put a curve on the plan,repeating her curves. Then, vypryamyvshy thread<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>measure its length ruler. </span></p>
