<span style="">Known that the surface is uneven. OnIt is relatively level areas, hills, ravines, mountains. For the relief image on a planor card, you must know the height <span class="SpellE">increases</span> and depthcuts the surface. To determine the height of terrain such as hillneed to measure the vertical distance from its sole to the top. This can bedone with leveling. <i style="">Leveling</i>- A simple device in the form of vertical rails with a height of 1 meter plummet andhorizontal bar. The sequence of measuring the height of it (call it <i style="">leveling</i>) As follows: firstset about leveling foot hill. According to plummet check whether strictlyit stands upright. Horizontal plate leveling should be directedthe slope. Along the fence &quot;take aim&quot; and pidmichayut point on a slope, in which shedirected. There peg hammer. If leveling height is 1 m, this pointwill be at 1 m above the point where there is a leveling. Then transfer to the levelingpeg and take aim at another point. The second point has to be higher at 2 m fromsole. So consistently leveling hop several times along the slope.After going to the top, the number of stakes define the height in meters hill.So find out how many meters one point (in our example - the tophill) is higher relative to other points (foot hill). This height is called <i style="">relative</i>. With leveling canmeasure the height of the river above water, ravine slope above its bottom, and others. </span></span></p>

<span style="">If you take a close look at fig .., thensee that the slope of a hill leveling asked four times. On the slope ofother hand it fits five times. This means that with one soleside may be below, on the other - better. Because of this, and the relative heightpeaks, measured from different sides the hill may be unequal. To avoidDISCREPANCIES in altitude, the plans and location maps indicate no relativeheight and absolute height. Her vidlichuyut on a single level - from sea level,serving as a 0.</span></span></p>

However, with different seadifferent level. From one of them to lead the countdown? In <i style="">Ukraine</i> and some other countries (Russia, Belarus, Moldova, etc.)..taken to keep counting the absolute height of surface points from the level <i>BalticSea</i>. To determine the absolute height of points, not necessarily go to himshores. In various places on the ground put special characters - <i style="">rappers</i>. They point to the height of thespace above the Baltic Sea. From that mark, having spent leveling,You can determine the height of any point. For example, the absolute height <i style="">Kyiv</i> - 180 m</span></p>
