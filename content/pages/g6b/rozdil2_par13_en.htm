In fact, our planet is such a visible, as inglobe, the axis has not. Axis can be mathematically calculated and only imagined. CoreGlobe shows where and which is imaginary tilt axis earth. Those points whereEarth&#39;s axis in and out of the globe, called <i style="">poles</i>. Top center - <i>North Pole</i>, Bottom - <i>Southpole</i>. It is known that the North Pole Polar star is seen directly abovehead. Middle of the globe surrounds a dark blue line - <i style="">equator</i>. The word &quot;equator&quot; in Latin means &quot;<span class="SpellE">rivnodilnyk</span>, Ie one that is shared in equal parts.Equator really divides Earth into two hemispheres: <i>North </i>(On the map -above), where we will live and <i>South </i>(Bottom). At the Earth&#39;s surface orpoles or equator line is not marked. As terrestrial axis, they exist onlyimaginary and may affect only a globe and maps. Globus makes it possible to imagineshape our planet, and so he called its volume model. </span></p>

That- The surface of our planet, only reduced by several million times. Globes,as plans, are out. It shows how many times in the Globesmaller than the real Earth. In contrast, plans to reduce terrestrial globesurface is very large. For example, on the map of scale 1: 30 000 <span class="SpellE">000</span> one centimeter uklalysya 30 million inches(Or 300 km) surface.

Soit only outlines of oceans, continents, islands and other geographicalobjects correspond to their true form. This means that not on the mapdistorted the distance between individual points.
