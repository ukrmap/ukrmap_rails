The initial stage is the extraction of iron and manganese ore, coking coal and non-metallic materials. Following is the enrichment of ores and coke, iron and steel making and rolling of alloys. Steel industry is very materialomistka (for one ton of steel is used more than 6 tons of raw materials, fuels and auxiliary materials). Because the steel industry located mainly near the iron ore and coal basin. Thus the steel parts of Russia (Urals, Kuznetsk), Ukraine (Donetsk, Pridneprovsky), Germany (Ruhr), Poland (Verhnosylezkyy), USA (Pennsylvania), China, India.</p><p class="rvps2"> feature of the location of ferrous metals at the present stage is a consumer-oriented materials and freight, that is - location close to major markets or adjacent to major transportation nodes. That&#39;s steel companies are Japan, South Korea, Italy, new factories in Germany, France, USA, Russia.</p><p class="rvps2"> largest producers of steel are China, USA, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Ukraine, India. Indicators of steel production per capita is highest in European countries (Luxembourg, Belgium, Czech Republic, Ukraine) and in Japan.</p><p class="rvps2"> for small European countries are characterized by a specialized mini-mills that produce high quality steel and rolled metal complex, as well as enterprises of processing industry (using scrap).<p class="rvps2"></p>
