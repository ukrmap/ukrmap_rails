<p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> Power </i> </b> - industry, which includes various types of electricity production and transportation of its power lines to the consumer. Development of electricity depends primarily on the level of economic development, energy availability, quality, location, method of extraction. Total output and consumption per capita is among the key indicators of economic level of development of any country. So <p class="rvps2"> majority of world electricity produced at thermal power plants (TPP) - 60% that use conventional fuels: coal, gas and fuel oil. Up to 20% of electricity produced world hydropower plants (HPP). In countries well-endowed hidroenerhoresursamy, this figure is much higher: Norway (99%), Brazil (92%), Austria, Canada, Peru, New Zealand - more than 50%.<p class="rvps2"> nuclear power plants (NPP) provides 17% of world electricity production. These stations use the energy of radioactive decay of uranium or plutonium. Nuclear power reactors operating in 32 countries. The largest share of electricity produced at the plant - in France (76%), Belgium (61%), Germany, Ukraine (50 %).</p><p class="rvps2"> Only 1% of world electricity generating plants that use non-traditional (alternative) energy sources: solar, wind, tidal, wave energy, bioenergy, geothermal energy. Most of them geothermal power plants that use the internal heat of the Earth (bar chart, a comment filed on the map <i> fuel resources </i>).</p><p class="rvps2"></p>
