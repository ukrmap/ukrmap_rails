<p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> Mineral Resources </i> </b> - a collection of mineral resources of mineral origin, which are already used or could be used in future economic activity. Nowadays, most used more than 200 types of minerals. Depending on the purpose of mineral resources is divided into three groups.</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Fuel </i> (energy) - are used to obtain heat and light.</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Wire </i> (ORE) - of which smelted metals (ores of ferrous and nonferrous metals).</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> of metal </i> (non-metallic) - used as raw material for chemical industry (potassium salt, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.), as construction and industrial raw materials (asbestos, graphite, diamond, etc.) .</p><p class="rvps2"> Deposits placed on the Earth very unevenly, because of the peculiarities of the tectonic structure of the crust. For a better understanding and explanation of patterns of minerals in tectonic map shows the area of continents (and platform fold belt).</p><p class="rvps2"> fuel and some non-metallic minerals that are of sedimentary origin, age emerged as a result of the accumulation of sedimentary rocks. Deposits of these minerals often found in sedimentary cover of ancient platforms and foothill areas of depression and the oldest old folding. In this tectonic relief structures correspond to the plain (see <i> physical map of the world </i>).</p><p class="rvps2"> mining and chemical non-metallic minerals also are mostly of sedimentary origin.</p><p class="rvps2"> Metallic minerals confined to the ancient Precambrian shields and platforms fold belt crust. That is why the richest in ore minerals are old low mountains, highlands and plateaus.</p><p class="rvps2"> Ores of ferrous metals (iron, manganese) in the crust layers are deposited, forming large-area pools.<p class="rvps2"> ores of nonferrous metals are deposited in the bowels of the Earth&#39;s original belts. Thus, copper ore and Polymetal common in the Cordillera orogen - the Andes, tin ore - in the Pacific zone.</p><p class="rvps2"> presence of mineral resources is a good precondition for economic development of any country.</p>
