This interval is conditionally divided into four periods:</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Antique (up to V </i> <i> </i> <i> century.) </i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> medieval (V-XV cent.) </i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> colonial (XV-XX </i> <i> </i> <i> century.) </i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> modern (twentieth-The Beginning </i> <i> </i> <i> century.) </i></p><p class="rvps2"> To introduce the process of PPP in the recent period, are the three maps:</p><p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> World in 1914 </i> </b> <b> <i> </i> </b> <b> <i> was </I> </b></p><p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> World in 1961 </i> </b> <b> <i> </i> </b> <b> <i> was </I> </b></p><p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> the map </i> </b></p><p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> Map of the World 1914 </i> </b> <b> <i> </i> </b> <b> <i> was </I> </b> shows how the world was before World War I: At that time there were only 55 sovereign states and huge colonial empire of France, Britain, Portugal, Austria-Hungarian, Ottoman, German and Russian empires.<p class="rvps2"> The map <b> <i> World in 1961 </i> </b> included changes to the PPP after two world wars and the destruction of colonial empires.

Over time, appeared and disappeared grand civilization, stood and destroyed mighty empire, and once secondary colonies grew on the impact of the state.</p><p class="rvps2"> largest state by population are China (over 1.35 billion people), the world leader in population growth is India: population increases annually by approximately 15 million Mongolia - The largest state, which has no outlet to the sea. In addition to such giants as Russia, China, India, U.S. on the planet are the states that area and population are no different from ordinary cities (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino).
