<p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> agroclimatic resources </i> </b> - the ratio of heat, moisture, light needed for growing crops. They are determined by geographical location within the territory of climatic zones and natural areas. Characterize the agro-climatic resources of three parameters.</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> sum of active air temperatures </i> (total average daily temperatures higher than 10 Â° C) in which plants are developing fastest.</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> active period with temperatures </i> (vegetation period) during which temperatures are favorable for plant growth. Distinguish short and long periods serednotryvalyy vegetation;</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Provision plants damp </i> (determined by the ratio of moisture).</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> moisturizing factor </i> - determined by the ratio of heat and moisture in a particular area and is calculated as the ratio of rainfall to vyparovuvanosti year. The higher the temperature, the greater vyparovuvanist and therefore less moisture ratio. The smaller the coefficient of moisture, the drier climate.</p><p class="rvps2"> Heat and Air on Earth are distributed according to the pulse and high-rise zoning poyasnosti. Therefore, ddiogelwch agroclimatic resources on Earth emit <i> agro-climatic zones, and zones pidpoyasy </i> <i> wetting </i>, with pulse propagation in the flat, and in the mountains change with height. For each agro-climatic zone and pidpoyasu examples of typical crop of specifying the duration of their growing season. Additionally maps <i> agroclimatic resources </i> is a map <b> <i> Types of Winter </i> </b>, which will help in the development of characteristic conditions and specialization of agriculture of the world.</p><p class="rvps2"> Depending on the geographical location of countries have different agro-climatic resources. These resources are inexhaustible, but their quality may vary with climate change and under the influence of human economic activity.</p>
