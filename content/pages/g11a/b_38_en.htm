<p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> Environmental problems </i> </b> - a problem caused by human interaction with the environment.</p><p class="rvps2"> polovnyk In the second century. due to excessive anthropogenic impact on nature in many countries and regions of the world environmental situation has reached the level of environmental crisis. Ecological crisis - a tense situation between man and nature as much human nature begins to change dramatically negative impact on social development and a threat to the existence of the human species. This is the reverse condition in which mankind if timely adequate response can still remedy the situation.</p><p class="rvps2"> Map shows areas that are criteria for environmental assessment referred to areas of ecological crisis:</p> <ul> <li> <i> ocean areas contaminated by petroleum products and other forms of economic activity ; </i> </li> <li> <i> industrial waste disposal areas in the oceans; </i> </li> <li> <i> areas decrease in forest cover due to industrial disforestation in the Northern Hemisphere and areas of destruction Tropical forests; </i> </li> <li> <i> areas most at risk of desertification. </i> </li> </ul><p class="rvps2"> state of ecological crisis typical of most large cities - industrial and transportation centers in the world. It almost destroyed natural landscapes and recorded excessively high levels of pollution of all components of the environment.<p class="rvps2"> to radiation contamination areas include areas of nuclear testing: the Pacific atolls, the Gobi desert (China), Nevada in the U.S., Fr. Novaya Zemlya (Russia), place of burial of radioactive wastes and places where accidents have suffered nuclear vessels, as well as areas that were contaminated as a result of accidents at nuclear power plant (USA, Russia, Ukraine).</p><p class="rvps2"> The world, unfortunately, is a territory, whose condition can be described as an ecological catastrophe - an abnormal state of nature, arising as a result of human activity, and leads to very negative consequences, or high morbidity and mortality population. An example for a zone of ecological disaster of the Chernobyl accident (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) and Pryurallya region (Russia) where in the last decade of XX century. resulting in depletion and water pollution and air sharply deteriorated living conditions of the population.</p><p class="rvps2"> Environmental issues relating to all mankind. Therefore they can only solve together. In 1992, at <i> International Ecological Forum </i> by representatives of 179 countries worldwide had adopted the most important document of today - <i> Humanity Action Programme for the XXI century. </I>, outlining the ways of international cooperation in this century to improve environmental quality and achieving high quality of life of the planet.</p>
