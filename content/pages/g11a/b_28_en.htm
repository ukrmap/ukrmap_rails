<p class="rvps2"> Engineer with the energy and chemical industry is the so-called avant-garde trio <i> </i> branches that ensure the development of scientific and technological progress. Modern engineering world consists of more than 200 industries. On the map <b> <i> Engineering and Metalworking </i> </b> provides specific group of branches. Yes <i> heavy </i> (general) Engineering manufactures process equipment for other industries: mining, energy, metallurgy and so on. In general machinery are also machine and agricultural machinery. These branches are targeted mainly at consumers and the areas of metallurgy.</p><p class="rvps2"> Automotive, railway engineering, shipbuilding, aviation and space industry relating to transport <i> </i> engineering. Production of different vehicles are labor intensive, therefore gravitate to big cities where there are qualified human resources.</p><p class="rvps2"> instrument combines precision engineering, electrical and electronics industries that are science-and labor-intensive. Leadership in production of precision engineering is highly developed countries, and in the production of household appliances leading position of the new industrial countries <i> </i> Asia and China.</p><p class="rvps2"> high level of engineering and metalworking are the Group of Seven countries <i> </i>, Russia and most European countries. There is a major engineering centers. In the world of engineering distinguish the following main areas:</p><p class="rvps2"> <i> </i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> North America (30% of world production); </i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Western Europe (30 %);</i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> East and Southeast Asia (20 %);</i></p><p class="rvps2"> <i> Russia and CIS countries. </i></p>
