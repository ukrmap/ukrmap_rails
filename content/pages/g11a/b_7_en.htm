<p class="rvps2"> As seen from the maps, world population is very unevenly placed. Illustrates the figure <i> population density </i> - the number of people of a territory to its area (people per km <sup> 2 </sup>). Also on the map filed the largest cities and metropolitan world.</p><p class="rvps2"> in the world, approximately 15% of land not so far settled about half the reclaimed areas have population density less than 5 people / km <sup> 2 </sup>, while there are others where this index reaches 1000 or more people / km <sup> 2 </sup>.</p><p class="rvps2"> <b> <i> population distribution </i> </b> has always depended on the environment (terrain, climate). Yes, 80% of humanity living on the plains, which occupy less than one third of terrestrial land. The most comfortable for living and economic activity is moderate and subtropical climate zones, so they are most populous. On the allocation of the population also affect the historical, socio-economic, demographic and other factors. Thus, the most populated regions in the world belong to the territory of ancient agriculture (Great Plain of China, Indo-Hanhska lowland valley of the Nile, Japanese Islands, Fr. Java) and staropromyslovi parts of Europe and eastern North America. Much the same population density in coastal North America, Africa, Australia associated with the history of development of these areas.<p class="rvps2"> schedule <i> population dynamics of the Earth in the past and forecast for the future </i> illustrates the so-called population explosion - rapid population growth. Home boomers, as the graphic accounts of the XVIII - XIX centuries. This period of industrial revolution in Western Europe. In the twentieth century. after the collapse of colonial empires in 50-60 years highest rates of population growth observed in developing countries, this trend continues today. According to the UN projections to the end of this century the population of the planet may reach 10 billion people.</p>
