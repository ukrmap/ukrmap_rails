<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Notably,Shelest figure in Ukrainian history is quite ambiguous and contradictory.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">On the one hand, it was clearStalin&#39;s representative of the administrative-command system. Ability to efficientlyfocus in difficult situations, timely certify their commitment to newleadership enabled Shelest a long period of time (from 1963 to 1972)maintained at the highest swords Republican Communist Party hierarchy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As Leonid Brezhnev, Shelest belonged toamong conservatives, the most consistent opponents of the process of de-Stalinization.They are both uncompromisingly opposed political reforms and to applythe most drastic measures <b style="">в </b>Combatdissident movement. It is known that it Shelest gave sanction to conductmass arrests of Ukrainian intelligentsia in August-September 1965 According toone of the leaders <i>&quot;Prague Spring&quot; 1968 O.<span class="SpellE">Dubcek</span>,
</i>Shelest was one of the initiators of armed intervention in <span class="SpellE">Czechoslovakia</span>Because it was afraid to spreaddemocratic ideas of this country in Ukraine.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">On the other hand, took the image Shelestmoderate champion of national interests of the Ukrainian people.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In particular, Shelest tried Ukrainizemanagerial personnel and demanded that the Ukrainian language within the language of the republic waskeeping.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Shelest with great interest andundisguised sympathy treated labor <i style="">І</i>.<i>Dziuba&quot;Internationalism or Russification?&quot;. </i><span style="">First</span>Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party even ordered rozmnozhyty and circulate it among hisenvironment, because it is adding the arguments in the debate on nationalproblems <i>з </i>higher leadership of the Communist Party.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Shelest subsequently used someposition of I.

Regarding the latter, then, according to experts, it was a normalahitka propaganda, but with minor excursions into the half-forgotten bypostwar period of Ukrainian history. Especially with great excitement andwarmth of the Central Committee of Communist Party First Secretary of Ukraine told about the glorious Cossackpast the Ukrainian people. Stressing that he is Cossack origin, Sheleststressed that the Cossacks were heroic defenders of Ukrainianpeople for that and won the eternal glory.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Originally Leonid Brezhnev relatively quietperceived &quot;Ukrainophilism&quot; Shelest, although from time to time with him on polemizuvavspecific issues of History of Ukraine.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev soughtfully Russify Ukraine. Under the policy of Russification of Communist Party ideologuessummarized the theoretical basis </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> the concept of so-called &quot;Soviet people&quot;, asnew community of people formed primarily on the basis of unshakeable <span style="">Unity<b> </b></span>threeEast nations </span>–<i><span style="color: black;"> RussiansUkrainian and Belarusian.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In this situation, candid &quot;Ukrainophilism&quot;Shelest for union leadership became politically dangerous. Leonid Brezhnev,however, does not cross the event, and gradually prepared the pound for removal of Shelestpower. Prerequisites for this was growing as <i>consolidation of power by Brezhnev inMoscow and V. Shcherbytskyi position in Ukraine.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The political career of Mr. Shcherbytskyistarted back in the days of Stalin in <i>Dniprodzerzhinsk </i>late 40&#39;s -in the first half of the 50&#39;s.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In thirtysix-year age he was elected to a second, and a year later the first secretary <i>Dnipropetrovsk</i>Regional Party Committee.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It was obvious that the presence of tworepresentatives of a republic in the top leadership of the party </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> ittemporary phenomenon, which they found their confirmation in May 1972 when V.Shcherbytskyi elected first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To strengthen his position,Ukrainian Communist leader newfound leadership for several yearsgradually and consistently <b style="">pozbavlyavsyasupporters Shelest</b>And to exempt positions appointed by their people.</span></p>

Withdrawal of party ticket then meant the end of career andin Soviet society was regarded as one of the harshest punishments.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">During the party leadership Shcherbytskyi V.republic in the second half of 70&#39;s again began to increase processRussification. On the initiative of Leonid Brezhnev in this period started to spreadthesis about the merger in the near future of nations and nationalities of the USSR into a single <i>&quot;Sovietpeople. </i>A huge army of social scientists, press, radio, television, allideological sphere have worked hard over the propaganda and justification of thisideas.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Russian language, which filed as a meansinternational communication, ousted from the Ukrainian education, science,culture and even of life.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In April 1978 adoptednew Constitution of the USSR, which was almost a carbon copy of the Constitution of the USSR in 1977</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Formally, the procedure for taking unionConstitution was designed in a democratic spirit.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">V.

But this idea ran <span style="">on </span>strong resistance leadersTranscaucasian republics, and so it was not implemented in the Constitution.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Constitution of the USSR(1977) and SSR (1978) further restricted the independenceRepublic, especially in economic sphere.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This meant the official fixingfull range of all-powerful party in all spheres of Soviet lifesociety. No such provision is not contained even in Stalin&#39;s Constitution1936</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The new constitution guarantees a widepolitical and economic rights of citizens, but in reality they do notimplemented.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In a high position of the firstSecretary of the Communist Party Central Committee for quite some time, Mr. Shcherbytsky, of course,tried to make the most of <span style="">develop<b>
