<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Social DevelopmentUkraine</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The main source of growth and conditionPeople&#39;s welfare is above the growth of national income. Itnoted that despite the serious economic development inBrezhnev to Gorbachev&#39;s period of &quot;perestroika&quot; in the republic this importantindicator of living standards had <i>strong tendency to increase.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Thus, from 1965 to 1985national income in Ukraine <b style="">increased2,5 times</b> and amounted to 96.6 billion rubles. Three-quarters <span style="">This<b> </b></span>amount reported inavailable to workers, employees, collective farmers in the form of fund consumption.If you take into account the annual expenditure for the construction and operation of housing,schools, hospitals, cultural and educational institutions, sports facilities, businessespublic service, he directly <i>to satisfy materialneeds of the population accounts for 80% of national income.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It is logical that in the republic inthis period, an increase of wages of workers and employees.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In particular, in the mid 60&#39;s wasincreased salaries of public education, health, trade,catering, housing and communal services. In 1972,salaries of doctors, teachers, childcare facilities,student scholarships were increased by 20-30%.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Total for 1965-1985 bienniumaverage money <b style="">wagealmost doubled</b>. An important indicator of growth and considerable prosperitypopulation was also increasing the minimum wage to 40-50 rubles. in 1965to 70 rubles. in 1977 and abolition of state taxes on it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Certain positive changes in this regardoccurred in agriculture. In particular, there has been increasing wagesin collective farms, from July 1, 1966 all collective farms have shifted toguaranteed cash payment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The average monthly salary in the 1965-1985 bienniumin collective farms has increased 3 times and the pace of its growth hasexceeded this figure in the industry. Due to the state and the economy in 1980kolkhoz pension increased by 40%.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The state of material well-being of the peopledetermined and consumption of public funds, provided that the development of nationaleducation, training workers, medical services,regular holiday pay, benefits, etc. permits.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Large allocations are allocated tomaternal and child health, improving working conditions and life women are mothers,pensions, scholarships and vocational students. Total amountpayments and benefits by public funds per capita consumption wasalso fairly large and has grown in the republic from 1968 to 1985 almost 5times.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">During the Brezhnev leadershipused by the state taking action to improve living standardsRepublic. Tremendous success of these measures have had in the period <span class="SpellE">kosyhinskyh</span>reforms.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, after their collapse and cease to70th </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> first half of 80 years in Ukraine began a sharpfalling production growth </span>–<span style="color: black;">leading factor affecting the quality of life of people.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As a result, significantly decreased and the rate ofgrowth of national income. Such processes each year reduced the amountpublic final product that spryamovuvavsya for rising living standards.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Consequently, the state budget afterfailure of economic reforms during the peak of the economic crisis and stagnationmainly replenished by not developing their own products, and <i>throughoverseas sales of such natural resources as oil and gas. </i>At obtained fromthese trading operations &quot;<span class="SpellE">petrodollars</span>&quot;Zakupovuvalysyascarce industrial goods and foodstuffs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">2. <span style="">Trade andeveryday life</span></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The same ambiguous and verycontradictory developments were taking place in trade and consumer servicespopulation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In the second half of the 60&#39;s </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> onearly 70 years have been positive developments in trade.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Strengthened material basedistribution network, resulting in significantly increased number of tradeenterprises. Consumer cooperatives, such as solving problems,state agencies, provide assistance to enterprises, collective farms and state farms, withfunds which built new shops, canteens, bakeries.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">With the increase of wagesand increased purchasing power.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Particularly active at this timeensured a growing demand for workers in cities and rural economicequipment and products of cultural and community use. In particular, the demand amongRepublic of used televisions, radios, refrigerators, washingmachines that in the second half of 60&#39;s appeared in every second family.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Increasing the number of goods requiredemergence of new, more sophisticated and effective forms of trade. Thereforewere convenience stores, department stores, Supermarkets with a wideinventory. Rural workers in this period were regularlyserved trade workers in places of work </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> oncamp, farm, in the tractor brigade.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Along with trade and developingdomestic services. Service life has become a major industrynational economy. Very popular in the population were usingcreated during this period home life, domestic industries, domestic firmsservices.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Among the first such enterprises inSoviet Union emerged Kiev firm &quot;Dawn&quot;, which had a servicesrenovation of apartments, child care and sick, teaching music and foreign languages,typewritten reprint and more. If the early 60&#39;s was such services80-90 species, in the mid-70&#39;s, their number increased to 600 or more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But the 70-80-ies intrade and consumer services of the republic beganshow negative trends.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Specifically, each year began to growstate retail prices for certain consumer goods. Valueall kinds of goods in 1980 compared with average annual prices in 1970increased by 3% in 1985 </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> 8%, and in particular food </span>–<span style="color: black;"> respectively 4% and 12%.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">All this has causedslower growth in real incomes, which in the 1975-1985 bienniumwere 10% lower nizhu previous decade.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">3. Housing</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">One of the important indicators of growthwelfare is housing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The main means of solving thistraditionally difficult problems for Ukraine in the period was the transferhousing <i>on industrial basis.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, the first newly built residentialarrays were marked with original architectural forms were quiteprimitive and homogeneous. It is recognized and leadership. Residentialconstruction made significant public investment that has allowedprovide in 1974 70% of households separate apartments.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The subject of special <span style="">note </span>architects and builderswas the capital of Ukraine </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> <i>Kyiv. </i>With their most creative workcity of the republic has become one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Organicallycombining a charming nature and original architecture, Kyiv received hisin fact, unique face. In the city there were whole blocks of multistoryhouses were built new subway lines are broken, beautiful parks andsquares. It was at this time born in Kiev <span class="SpellE"><i>Rusanivka</i></span><i>,Otradnyy Syrets, </i>end of <i><span style="">Bereznyaky, <span class="SpellE">Borschagovki</span>,<b> </b></span>Forest </i>andother residential areas.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Similar neighborhoods built in the <i>KharkivDnipropetrovsk, Vinnytsia. Lviv. </i>In this period appeared on the map of Ukrainenew city - <i><span style="">Svitlovodsk </span>Novovolynsk,Ukrainian, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dnieper</span></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Vilnogirsk</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 60-80-ies in the republic begandevelop cooperative housing construction. With the increase of materialsecurity and increasing the number of people wishing to improve their housing <span style="">conditions<b> </b></span>own expense. However, inprices observed in the case of more spontaneity and imperfection.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Along with rapid developmenturban construction are the same processes occur in the countryside, to a large extent why<i><span style="">contributed </span>state. </i>In particular,State Bank <span style="">provided </span>cash loansrural developers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To expand the building in the country wassignificantly strengthened the material base <i>mizhkolhospnyh construction companies </i>createdin the mid 50&#39;s. Before them there was a problem </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;">Villages in turn arranged modern village. They are usually createdon new, blank spaces or by reconstruction of old villages.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Since 1965 practice in Ukrainea pilot-demonstration villages. Despite the ideological characterthis practice, experience of building experimental demonstration villages <span style="">showed<b> </b></span>that are convenient for lifeand of rural building complexes occurred when they organicallycombined the best folk tradition with the achievements of modern architecture. In1966-1970 biennium there were 15 such<b> </b>settlements, the nextFive of their number has almost doubled.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Since 1970 priorityrural development <span style="">area<b> </b></span>wasproclaimed reconstruction <span style="">old </span>villages.At the All-Union review-competition 1970 the best construction and landscapingsuch settlements <span style="">among<b> </b></span>25other villages in the number of winners named <i><span style="">with.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, in another period ofliving <span style="">construction, </span>as inall other industries, began a perceived lowproduction growth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">If the 1966-1970 biennium their housingconditions improved <span style="">almost<b> </b></span>9million, in the 1980-1985 biennium only 7,7 million housing problem, asstill remained sharp, the state had the necessary resources for itssuccessful solution. In addition, the current practice of distribution of apartments inlack of democracy, effective social control did not satisfyworkers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Many of the complaints raised and low qualitybuilt public housing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In rural construction, such asused many <i>unsuccessful standard, slurred projects </i>residential,economic, cultural and residential buildings. In some areas of Ukraine leadershipunreasonably zahoplyuvalosya buildings villages multistoried building thatgreatly complicated the peasants of private households.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Falling profitability and collectivestate-farm production, shortage of building materials, their high costcaused the slowdown in construction, rural workers were forcedbuild housing by hand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In rural areas, a thousandhousing residents was reduced twice less than in cities, the share of ruralpoints, provided natural gas was less than 7%, water supplyresidents use only 14,6% of villages of the republic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">4. <span style="">Statehealth care</span></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Quite ambiguous situation andin health care population.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">At first glance, the state did a lot ofto health care workers was, as saying the Sovietleaders, at a level corresponding to world standards.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This allocated significant fundsinvested in building new clinics, hospitals, health centers, homesrest.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Constant attention is paid to preparequalified medical personnel and their improvement. Thus, in Ukraine 60-70-iesoperated 15 medical universities and dozens of secondary special medicalschools.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Through their activities in 1960-1975 bienniumnumber of doctors and nurses increased by more than 1,5times, and to provide for every 300 inhabitants of the republic and one doctorthree nurses. Party and government leaders proudly reported that such highindex has not reached any of <span class="SpellE">highly</span> countriesworld.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But these statistics reflectonly the outer side of the national medicine.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In the years of stagnationdue to lower living standards, poor working conditions andLife, the spread of alcoholism, Commissariat of the health care problem of people decidedextremely poor.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Acute and personnel remained a problem.Because the overwhelming majority of qualified health workers was not onhighest level.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The reason for this was thoughtless <b style="">technocratism</b>, Predominance of narrowinterests. Disregarding the interests of the people, powerful, technically equipped ministrydepartments, industrial associations carried sanctioned &quot;from above&quot;large-scale construction, irrigation, chemical and other works. Typically,they are not based on deep scientific calculations and analysis of possibleconsequences.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Through such barbaric treatmentNature mercilessly destroyed Ukrainian fertile land. Unreasonable irrigationmeasures chemicalization without proper feasibility studies and practical experiencecaused violations of the Dnieper water balance, pollutionenvironment, pesticides, nitrogen fertilizers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In particular, the 60-80-ies markedlyslow pace of its growth. Surge caused by urbanization and itsmigration have led to <i>outflow of young people from the village, </i>which has always beenmain source of reproduction of human resources.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Fertility in rural areas fardecreased, and already in 1979 average rural family size equal tocity index </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> 3 persons per family.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In turn, reduction in citiesbirth was associated <span style="">з<i>poor social and domestic factors: </i></span>high employmentwomen in social production (nine out of ten working women), lowthe level child welfare, difficult living conditions, a gradualincreasing children&#39;s orphanage and more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Logical consequence of this wasreducing population growth in Ukraine 60-80-years 4 times.
