The main reasons for its <span style="">exaltation<b> </b></span>in Ukraine were: almost stateless statusRepublic; monopoly power of the Party and Soviet bureaucratic elite;constant harassment and restrictions of national cultural development, motivatedRussification of the Ukrainian population.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In the late 50&#39;s </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> onearly 60&#39;s <span style="">all </span>available <span style="">positive<b> </b></span><i>opportunitiesKhrushchev&#39;s &quot;thaw&quot; was virtually exhausted. </i>The strategic line of reformcome into contradiction with the existing political system, which is no longerpermitted major changes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In these circumstances, &quot;the Sixties&quot; graduallyformed opposition power structures. But the opposition, which operated mainly inwithin the existing system, according to the rules of the game that initsiyuvalysya &quot;from above&quot;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, in parallel at this time <span style="">begins<b> </b></span>deploy anotherkind of opposition movement, which <span style="">subsequentlywas<b> </b></span>called <i>&quot;Dissident&quot;.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Unlike legalcultural sixties, using weakening of totalitarianism andliberalization that took place in the country, new fighters for national rightsUkrainian began as much as possible organically combine the undergroundactivity with some legal methods of struggle.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

First touch <b style="">Human nations</b>And the second </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> <b style="">Human Rights</b>. A characteristic feature views of dissenters was thatthey do not divide the nation&#39;s rights and human rights, no one opposed themother and considered as a unit.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In the socio-political aspect is newgeneration of national-patriotic forces continued to maintain and develop <b style="">democratic and legal traditions</b>. Sonot accidental that the time actually taken as synonymous terms <span class="SpellE">dissidence inherent</span>, <span class="SpellE">pravozahysnytstvo</span> anddissent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Feeling that the opposition movementserious danger the regime, party and state structuresUkraine have sought to uncompromising and decisive battle with opposition <b style="">KGB</b>.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It should be noted that despite the processliberalization of Soviet punitive organs worked, still prettyactively.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The decision followed not onlytactically union activists, but also <i>awareness of the historicaltradition of political struggle </i>in Ukraine in late XIX <i>–</i> earlyXX century.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Assessing the draft program of Ukrainianworker-peasant unions should emphasize that the purpose to whichwanted this organization was to bring Ukraine from the USSR.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Essential impetus for this was the wavearrests of dissidents, who swept in the mid 60&#39;s.

Were arrested <i>JohnSvitlychny brothers and Michael Bohdan Horyn, Michael CBS </i>et al. they do notwas presented the specific charges, but instead in the country began activelyspread rumors about the exposure of anti-Soviet nationalistorganization.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The main requirement seemed fairly balanced<i>–</i> <i>return to the principles of party leadership of LeninNational Policy </i>(Book I.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But even this moderate programwas already evidence of the legal objections of the official policy of the Sovietregime.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Written with great talent anderudition, the book of I.
