<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">After Stalin&#39;s death in March 1953country was in a terrible legacy of remembrance of the bloody repression, millionslost and crippled souls and together with it - brutal totalitariansystem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It is clear that the death of the &quot;leader of all timeand peoples &quot;did not mean death or Stalinism or totalitarianism, which in manyyears of its existence ukorenylysya deeply in people&#39;s minds.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But the first steps towards de-StalinizationUkraine began to be felt quickly - immediately after the actual recognitionMarch 1953 <b style=""><i>Khrushchev </i>firstSecretary of the CPSU Central Committee </b>and his <span style="">official</span>election to that post in September 1953</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Since his rise to power beginssignificant personnel changes and change of leadership in the field.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In Ukraine, the change in partyleadership <span style="">в<i> </i></span>this timealso occurs <i>in Lithuania and Latvia. </i>It is possible that these human manipulationhave been pre-planned <b style=""><i>Л.<span class="SpellE">Beria</span></i></b><i>, </i>which has been prepared to seize statepower is through the party leadership non-Russian national republicsthat incriminated him, and during <span style="">arrest<b>
</b></span>in June 1953</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But <i>Ukrainian leadership <span style="">supported L.</span><span class="SpellE">Beria</span>.
</i>As <span style="">subsequently<b> </b></span>foundformer Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian <span style="">partisan</span>General movement <i>Т.<span class="SpellE">Strokach</span> </i>risk toown life told Khrushchev to prepare anti-state conspiracy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The coming to power of Nikita Khrushchev to some extentinfluenced the process Ukrainization management personnel as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. andSoviet Union as a whole. After the victory over their political opponentsKhrushchev in many ways it was obliged to Ukrainian <span style="">party<b> </b></span>managers, which has maintained strong tiesand during his tenure as first secretary of Central Committee <span class="SpellE">КП</span>(B) U.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As a result, already XVIII Congress of the Communist Party thatin March <span style="">1954</span>,further reinforced the trend Ukrainization party <span style="">leadership </span>Republic. In particular, the newly elected Central CommitteeCommunist Party of Ukraine Ukrainian relative share increased from 62% to 72%, all eight membersPolitburo were Ukrainian, Ukrainian positions not only received the first and second <i>(Kirichenkoand M</i>.<span class="SpellE"><i>Piedmont</i></span><i>), </i>but two moreSecretary of the Central Committee.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">These positive changes also affected the Republicanstate apparatus in which high government posts occupied playwright <i>A. Korneichuk,Semen Stefanik, </i>son of the famous Ukrainian writer <i>Vasil Stefanik, </i>andother Ukrainian public and political figures.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">At the head of Trade Unions of Ukraine alsoinstead of Russian <i>А.<span class="SpellE">Klebanov</span> </i>was toUkrainian <i>К.<span class="SpellE">Moskalets</span>. </i>Significant staffrearrangements occurred in the republican Interior Ministry after the arrestassociates and sympathizers L.<span class="SpellE">Beria</span> in Ukraine <i>П.<span class="SpellE">Meshyka</span>.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Substantially increased representation UkrainianAll Union and management. In particular, the first secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee <i>Kirichenko </i>waselected to the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee. Before the All-Union Government entered about tenof that used to work in Ukraine. Ukrainian greatly enlarged Steeringthe Armed Forces of the USSR. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">During this period, emerging new trendsin the formation of the Ukrainian political elite. It became dominant people <i>startedhis career in agricultural production </i>to be with himbound. Most of them came from central and northeasternregions of Ukraine. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This new wave of higher levels UkrainizationParty and state power was caused by two important circumstances. <i>Fromone hand, </i>it showed changes in Ukraine after the SecondWorld War II, primarily - the Ukrainian nation; <i>the other </i>–<i>
</i>demonstrated a new attitude to the Republican Federal Centerleadership. In particular, Nikita Khrushchev, in order to limit the power of their opponents,agreed on giving more powers to national leadership inRepublican solving important problems. As a result, opportunitiessenior party and state bodies of the republic significantly increased by enhancingautonomist aspirations and personal ambitions of their leaders.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">An extremely important step towardsde-Stalinization and liberalization of Soviet society was the XX Congress of the CPSU, whichheld in February 1956</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In reports of Khrushchev notcontained no sensational claims. In it, in contrast, proved declaredcourse of the party to defuse international tensions, considered importanteconomic and social problems, proudly advantages of collectiveleadership &quot;, launched in the country in recent years. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">These issues were the focusdelegates <span style="">were<b> </b></span>onCongress. Only <i>А.<span class="SpellE">Mikoyan</span> </i>In his speechgently touched on the problem <i>&quot;Cult <span style="">person</span>Stalin, </i>subjecting doubt some conclusions known Stalinist <i>Brieflyyear history of the CPSU (b) &quot; </i>(Including review of developments in civil warUkraine), and was publicly <span style="">saying </span>aboutthat <i>С.<span class="SpellE">Kosior</span> </i>and <i>В.<span class="SpellE">Antonov-Ovsienko</span>
</i>were not &quot;enemies&quot;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">On the last day of the Congress, when approvedResults of voting for the election of the governing bodies of the party, Khrushchev tolddelegates that they should meet in closed session. <i>On the night of 24 to 25February M</i>.<i>Khrushchev during four hours of credit in the congress delegatesreport &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot;.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Since that report, Congress delegateslearned <i>&quot;Political testament&quot; Lenin, </i>whose existence for many yearszamovchuvalosya and <span style="">disputed<b> </b></span>leadershipparty. The report told about Stalin distorted the principle ofdemocratic centralism <span style="">Related<b>
</b></span>this &quot;Stalinist purges and mass repression. In addition, Nikita Khrushchev almostuncovered myths about Stalin as a &quot;descendant&quot; and &quot;brilliant continuation of&quot; businessLenin, the prominent warlord, who actually was the main culprithorrible defeat the Red Army in 1941-1942 biennium</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The Congress was firstshows the true figure of Stalin </span></i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">–<i> figure cruel tyrant and dictator. </i>ReportKhrushchev literally shocked many Communists, for memories <span style="">participants </span>Congress, several delegateseven lost consciousness, they quietly brought to the meeting room.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It should be noted that criticism of the cultperson Stalin XX Party Congress was though blunt, but still shallowand not deep enough. <span style="">It<b> </b></span>containeda serious analysis of system principles and the main causes of the regimepersonal power, the former leader of the Soviet state. Main sourcesStalin cult vbachalysya primarily in acute nevschuhayuchiy classstruggle, and most importantly - in negative terms, the very nature of Stalin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Notwithstandinggreat information <span style="">Saturation </span>andemotionality, report M</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.<i>Khrushchev concealed rather than a true portrayalpicture of the crimes of Stalinism. </i>In it, in particular, <span style="">judge</span>erted only <i>external parties totalitarianism </i><span style="">(Cult </span>person &quot;) and the most impressiveEvents abuse state <span style="">power(Mass </span>repression). Politics is the party in general at all stagessocialist construction was considered correct. Congress did not <span style="">discussed the report </span>Khrushchev andreceived on this issue only a brief resolution that contained a fewlines.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, this limited criticism and positive impacton health policy and <span style="">moral-psychologicalatmosphere </span>in society.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">She helped break the icehuman fear and long silence, finally revealing the truth about the methodssocialist construction in the USSR.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Natural consequences of XX Congress of the CPSUa true revolution in public consciousness, enduring stereotypes Imagethinking, critical assessment of past events. This crucial period in the lifeSoviet people, for the apt expression Erenburg II, was subsequently named <b style="">&quot;Khrushchev thaw&quot;</b>As a kind ofamong short-term warming of winter.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In fact, the essenceexisting political regime is not actually changed. But its leaders havedid not want to use in the management of violent terrorist statemethods.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">2. <span class="SpellE">De-Stalinization</span>in Ukraine</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To direct criticism of Stalinism inmore moderate mainstream, the CPSU Central Committee June 30, 1956 adopted Resolution <i>&quot;Onovercoming the cult of personality and its <span style="">consequences &quot;,</span></i><span style="">which<b> </b></span>wasundoubtedly a step backwards in comparison with Khrushchev&#39;s speech at the congress XX</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Stalin in this documentcharacterized as <i>&quot;The man who fought for a cause <span style="">socialism, </span></i>and its crimes portrayed <span style="">as </span>limitations innerdemocracy, which were inevitable in a brutal struggle with &quot;classenemies. &quot;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The process of de-Stalinization advancedgradually vertically, which manifested itself in condemnation of the &quot;personality cult&quot; from top tobottom of all political organizations and ideological institutions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In Ukraine, this process was somewhat <span style="">slower </span>than in the center. Particularlysignificant delay in the Republican press articles began to appear underslogan <i>&quot;In light of the decisions XX Congress. </i>The general tone and contentcritical speeches were most fairly balanced and reasonable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Political Signs <span style="">&quot;Thaw&quot; </span>more felt in the field of culturallife. Ukrainian culture began to return the names of forgotten or unreasonablyillegally repressed figures. Enormous integrity and perseverance in thiswork revealed <b style=""><i>M. Rila</i></b><i>.
</i>Due to his active work was posthumously rehabilitated poets <i>O. Oleand </i><i style="">М</i>.<i>Blackie.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1956, in republicanmedia, the first news of the rehabilitation of UkrainianWriters, repressed during the Stalinist terror: <i>V.Ellana-blue,G. Solitaire, M.<span class="SpellE">Irchan</span></i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="EN-US">,</span></i><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> V. Chumak, O. Dosvitnii,I. Mykytenka </span></i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">et al. A number of works of these writers was published in <i>AnthologyUkrainian poetry &quot; </i>and collection <i>&quot;The revolutionary poets of the Western Ukraine.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In newspapers and magazines have become increasinglyarticles appear rehabilitated writers. Those <span style="">з </span>illegally repressed that remained alive after rehabilitationgradually involved in the cultural life of the republic. In this periodlaunched a campaign for the return of fair famous names of UkrainianCulture - playwright <b style=""><i>Gein</i></b><i>,
</i>film-maker <b style=""><i>О.<span style="">Dovzhenko </span></i></b>director <b style=""><i style="">Л</i>.<i>Kurbas</i></b><i>
</i><span style="">та<i> </i></span>others.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Along with rehabilitation of famous artistsstarted to unfold and rehabilitation processes separate party,government and military figures.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">An important impetus for this waselimination of autumn 1953 such terrible instruments of Stalinist terror,whether military tribunals and so-called <i>&quot;Special meeting&quot;. </i>Last had the right toadministratively enforce such brutal punishment asexile, imprisonment and deportation to the camps outside the country.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Tangible step towardsdemocratization of political life was also the abolition of emergencyof order <span style="">Affairs<b> </b></span><i>&quot;Aboutpreparing and committing terrorist acts &quot;.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1954 specifically designedCommission of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee to study the materials of mass repression during <i>&quot;Bigcleansing </i>1936-1939 biennium As a result of her work have been rehabilitated <span style="">known<b> </b></span>Ukraine people - <i>В.<span class="SpellE">Zatonsky</span>, E.<span class="SpellE">Kviring</span>, S.<span class="SpellE">Kosior</span>, J.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In addition, in September 1955 wereamnesty citizens who were accused of collaboration with Germanoccupiers during WWII.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This decision was <span style="">important </span>for <span style="">Ukraine,<b>
</b></span>with many Ukrainian, especially residents of the western regions, whichwere in Nazi-occupied territories were arbitrarily accused of&quot;Aiding and abetting the enemy&quot; and sent to Siberia or other remote areasSoviet Union. As announced amnesty for 1957 with imprisonmentreturned more than 65 000 former members of the OUN and the Warriors <span style="">UPA.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In general, at the end of 50 years byKGB and the Prosecutor of Ukraine has been viewed almost 5.5 million business people, but<i>only 58% of <span style="">them<b> </b></span>wererehabilitated. As before, remained outlawed most of the victims of political20&#39;s repression </i>–<i> early 30&#39;s, as well as persons who were accusedin Ukrainian nationalism.</i></span></p>

Khrushchev after the death of StalinXX Congress and supported KRPS, soon began to lose its force.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As a result of deteriorating relations between <i>supportersReform and Conservative </i>ruling elite of the time actually split into twohostile camps.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Antyhruschovsku</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> opposition ledchairman of the Federal Government <b style=""><i>Г.<span class="SpellE">Malenkov</span></i></b><i>, </i>his deputy <b style=""><i>Molotov</i></b><i> </i>and headState Committee on Labour and wages <b style=""><i>Л.<span class="SpellE">Kaganovich</span>.</i></b><i> </i>Because offierce struggle for power in January 1955 G.<span class="SpellE">Malenkov</span>was removed as Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, which instead embracedmarshal <i style="">М.<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bulganin</span></span><span style="">.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Most acute confrontation betweenreformers and conservatives have reached the summer of 1957, when the cohesive&quot;Stalin&#39;s Guard&quot; decided to give open battle Khrushchev. Taking advantage of itsdue to the lack of an official visit to Finland, the oppositionJune 18, 1957 asked about the resignation of First Secretary atmeeting of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But organizers of the stateRevolution is not fortunate. In the confrontation, which lasted four days, the important roleplayed heads of power structures - <b style=""><i>G. Zhukov</i></b><i>
</i>(Army) and <b style=""><i style="">І</i>.<i>Serov</i></b><i> </i>(KGB). They provide operationalDelivery of members of the party Central Committee in Moscow.</span></p>

Subsequently, they were quickly shifted fromhigh government positions. In this open power struggle <i>Ukraine&#39;s leadershipwas completely on the side of Khrushchev </i>and consistently supported it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Defeat <span class="SpellE">antyhruschovskoyi</span> gave the opposition a chance to preserve manufacturedpolicies and prepare a solid foundation for the next round updateand liberalization of Soviet society.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Once you resolve political opponents, Nikita Khrushchevto strengthen their position made several personnel changes. In November1957, in the person feeling <b style=""><i>G. Zhukov</i></b><i>,
</i>who led the army, a serious threat to the party dictatorship, Nikita Khrushchevrelieved of his duties as defense minister and appointed to this postnative Ukraine Marshal <b style=""><i>A. Malinowski</i></b><i>.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In December 1957 First SecretaryCentral Committee Communist Party of Ukraine <b style=""><i>Kirichenko</i></b><i>
</i>was elected secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and headed the Communist Party became <b style=""><i>М.<span class="SpellE">Piedmont</span></i></b><i>.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In early 1958 Nikita Khrushchev removedfrom the post of Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers <b style=""><i>М.<span class="SpellE">Bulganin</span></i></b><i> </i>and he led the Federal Government.Consequently, the two highest positions in the country - the party and state were inhands of one person.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1960, to the presidencyPresidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR instead of 79 years <i style="">А.<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Voroshilov</span></span><span style=""> </span></i>was nominated <b style=""><i>Leonid Brezhnev</i></b><i>.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, Khrushchev, according to historians, notdescribed as &quot;Stalinist autocrat in order&quot;, rather he is survived by hisshould like <i>&quot;Candidate for Stalin.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The next stepde-Stalinization of Soviet society was <b style="">XXII Congress of the CPSU</b>, Held in 1961</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It about the criminal activities of Stalintalked openly, forgetting already on his faithful companions and improvised <i>К.<span class="SpellE">Voroshilov</span>. L.<span class="SpellE">Kaganovich</span> and Molotov.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">One of the most prominent role during theStalin played <b style=""><i>Л.<span class="SpellE">Kaganovich</span></i></b><i>, </i>whose activity was closelyconnected with Ukraine.

After that he could afford to forget about criticismStalin and even commend it to individual works, call it again&quot;Marxist-Leninist outstanding, declare that <i>party &quot;should pay <span style="">name </span>Stalin&#39;s enemies of communism. &quot; </i>After<span style="">further deepening </span>de-Stalinizationthreatened to have the same foundation of the totalitarian system.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This is why de-Stalinization process in generalperformed consistently, inconsistently, often Subject to tacticalmaneuvers and political calculations Khrushchev.
