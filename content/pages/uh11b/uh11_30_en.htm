The program was supported by a majority governmentMPs, voted for it and the opposition. However, implementation ofslogans and promises turned out to be not easy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The Government has set itself some keytasks: 1) fill the state budget through the elimination of privilegestax-free economic zones and various shady schemes receivingincome; stop smuggling, manipulation of the VAT return, 2) increaseincome by increasing wages, widening socialpayments and so on. 3) re-privatization of illegally privatized property.

Since the spring2005 rapidly increased meat prices (incentive program was the Government&#39;ssmuggling - smuggling - STOP! »and growing demand inresult of growing incomes), then oil (provokedskyrocketing global oil prices and a conspiracy of Russian oil tradersowned monopoly that the Ukrainian market) and then in sugar (the desire&quot;Sugar Kings&quot; to get profits) as a result - untwisted flywheelinflation. To overcome these difficulties the government resorted to administrativeintervention, thus denying the principles proclaimed free market.Ukraine pushed by foreign investors question re.

Many times conflicts broke out in the governmentalteam, 80% of which were not associates said.

Also, the opposition used to their advantage arrests I. cutters,Boris Kolesnikov (Chairman of Donetsk Regional Council) and Kushnaryov.
