<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Economic reform was to reorganize<b style=""> </b>administration of the principles <i>cost accounting,self-support and self-financing. </i>Expanding law firmslease and began implementation of corporate entities createdcooperatives in the trade and industry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Success was associated with acceleration <i>decentralizationManagement </i>national economy. Integral element of this reform in Ukrainewas to be introduced by April 1988 with general control scheme,providing for transition of enterprises <i>from a command toEconomic methods of management.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Therefore, at the January (1987)Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee spoke about conservatism, criticized those who would notabrogate the principles and pushing to the forefront is not accelerating, and democratizationsocial life.</span></p>
