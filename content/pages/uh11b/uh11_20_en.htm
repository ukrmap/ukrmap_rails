Tocommunicate their ideas they created illegal publications </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> &quot;Samizdat&quot;in which the printed literary works, documents, journalistic articles.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The first time such &quot;<span class="SpellE">self-releasing</span>&quot;in Ukraine <span style="">appeared<b> </b></span>in1964, they spread little-known works &quot;Sixties&quot; <i>Mr.V.Symonenko,L.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">One form of protest against the existingpolitical regime, the refusal of certain representatives of the dissident movementSoviet citizenship, submitting requests for travel abroad.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Typically, these performances endedfor the opposition camps or imprisonment, but under international pressurepublic some of them managed to break abroad.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The tools and techniques to control dissidentswas quite varied.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">First tried just dissatisfiedintimidating. This practiced special <i>&quot;Conversation&quot; in </i>KGB,organized various &quot;campaigns&quot; in the press. If these &quot;preventive&quot;measures do not help </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> used <i>administrative sanctionsincluding dismissal.</i></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Final Act of the repressive measureswere arrested and detained. Dissidents largely condemned by <i>Anti-Sovietagitation and propaganda &quot; </i>with treatment of the articles of the CriminalCode was too broad.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">When this fell within the qualification:discussion on prohibited themes dissidents (even family), storage anddistributing banned literature &quot;samizdat&quot; and others. Often dissidentsnot condemned as a criminal and political offenders.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Incarceration was only one ofterrible punishment of dissidents, their position after the conviction was difficultthey served in prison, mostly in camps strengthened regime wheremost of the time spent in isolation cells. For the least blame themplanted in punitive isolators. Attempts to appeal remained unanswered, andprisoners were punished severely.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, in these conditions political prisoners continuedstruggle. A very common method of protest was a hunger strike. But to die fromfamine, political prisoner was not entitled. When he reached the critical state, itsbegan to force feed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Besides the usual prison, widelypracticed sending opposition to the special psychiatric hospitalstype.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">If a prisoner in a camp or prison afterserving a term of imprisonment hoped to reach freedom, in &quot;<span class="SpellE">psikhushka</span>&quot;dissidents could be &quot;treated&quot; at least until death. Among the victims of this terror weregeneral <b style=""><i>Petro Grigorenko</i></b><i>, </i>mathematician<b style=""><i>Leonid Ivy</i></b><i>, </i>doctor <b style=""><i>Nikolai <span class="SpellE">Plakhotnyuk</span></i></b><i>
</i>and many others. Total number of dissidents who have become &quot;patients&quot;psyhlikaren unknown. According Plyushch, in 70 years in the USSR wereabout two thousand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Thus, the powertried all possible means to isolate from society hazardouspeople themselves. </span></i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But these methods have different methods of cilia 30&#39;s when the managementcountries carried out the mass killing of their opponents.
