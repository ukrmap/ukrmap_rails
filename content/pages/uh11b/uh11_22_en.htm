<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The economic crisis has hit hard andin Ukraine. In 1990 Gross National Product was 2.4% lower thanprevious year, national income fell by 3,6% respectively. For the first timepost-war years in the republic there has been an absolute reduction of output of goodsconsumer.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1990, in Ukraine <i>agricultureeconomy </i>employed 19,4% of the population, <i><span style="">industrial<b> </b></span>production </i></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> 53,8%. <i>inService </i></span>–<span style="color: black;"> 24,4% (in developedWestern countries the majority of the population employed in services).</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The policy of the central leadershipled to that in Ukraine there was a very high potential of basic industriesproduction.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Much of the Ukrainianindustry has been militarized, that is focused on the issue of militaryvehicles and weapons.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">About 30% of military-industrialthe Soviet Union fell to Ukraine, about 80% of engineeringindustries were involved in weapons production.
