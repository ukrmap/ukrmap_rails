<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It was so obvious that evensome high-level representatives of the then Ukrainian authoritieshad to say during the discussion of the reforms that the Ukrainian languageshould remain mandatory study in Russian language schools.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Therefore, thisproblem was considered in detail and in principle at the July (1955)CPSU Central Committee plenum, which, inter alia, stated that the Soviet Union is&quot;At the dawn of a new scientific and technical and industrial revolution that farahead in value to the industrial revolution, associated with the advent of steam andelectricity &quot;.
