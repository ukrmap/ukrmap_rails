<p class="rvps2"> Engineer plays a role in modern terms the base complex, which is formed around a rational structure of the economy of the country. Field depends on the state of logistics and progress of all branches and levels of human life.</p><p class="rvps2"> As shown in maps, engineering centers are located in Ukraine quite evenly, although nearly half the volume of production, number of employees, the cost of industrial-production funds accounted for three engineering districts of Kharkiv, Donbass, Pridneprovsky.</p><p class="rvps2"> <em> Metalomistke </em> <em> heavy </em> releases machinery equipment and machinery for mining, electricity, metallurgy, construction. It tends to raw materials (metal) and the consumer and therefore located in the Donbass and Dnipro (Dnipropetrovsk, pattern recognition Gorlovka, Krivoy Rog, Donetsk, Kharkov).</p><p class="rvps2">-oriented human resources and network of communications <em> Transport </em> Engineering actually located in most regions of Ukraine.</p><p class="rvps2"> Given <em> </em> on the potential of our country some of the world&#39;s automobile giants gathering place their cars in Ukrainian enterprises. Thus, <em> automotive </em> in Ukraine is represented by a number of enterprises of different capacities: Lviv, Cherkasy, Borispol (buses), Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv (trolley), Kiev, Lutsk, Uzhgorod, Odessa (cars), Kremenchug ( trucks), Good Friday Ladan Village District (auto fire). This list must be added companies that produce components and assemblies for cars (Simferopol, Kherson, Kharkov).</p><p class="rvps2"> Shipbuilding: Nikolaev (tankers), Kherson (sea and river vessels), Kyiv, Kerch, Feodosiya.</p><p class="rvps2"> Aircraft and of space technology in developing cities with a large scientific and technical potential and highly qualified personnel (Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya). Locomotive: Luhansk, Kharkiv.</p><p class="rvps2"> carriage Enterprises located in Kremenchuk, Dneprodzerzhinsk, Mariupol, close to the metal centers.</p><p class="rvps2"> mostly consumer-oriented agricultural <em> </em> Engineering submitted in Ternopil, Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, Kharkov, White Church.</p><p class="rvps2"> Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Zaporozhye Machine are businesses and precision engineering, which tend to qualified personnel.</p><p class="rvps2"> incomplete list would be without companies operating on the needs of the military industrial complex (in Kharkov and Kiev are made and modernize tanks, armored personnel carriers and other special equipment).</p><p class="rvps2"> summary, note: this sector has a high scientific potential, highly skilled workforce. Therefore, development engineer (especially high-technology) is a major priority of the state. Further development of the industry requires technical modernization, reconstruction and modernization of production, including by converting the former military-industrial complex.</p>
