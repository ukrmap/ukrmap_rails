<p class="rvps2"> presence of a large resource base and sustained demand for products resulted in the formation <em> Chemical Industry </em> as a powerful component of the state economy. Mining and basic chemistry, organic synthesis chemistry, pharmaceutical and microbiological industry uses oil, gas, coal, waste production, wood product output, which is widely used in industry and daily life.</p><p class="rvps2"> <em> Enterprises </em> <em> Mining and Chemical </em> industries represented in Kalush, Stebnik (potassium salt), Slavic, Artemivsk Solotvino (salt), New Rozdol, maple (sulfur) and focused on raw materials.</p><p class="rvps2"> <em> Production of </em> <em> basic chemistry </em> is much needed in the national economy fertilizers, acid, soda. Production of potash tends to raw (Kalush, Stebnyk), nitrogen - to coke and metallurgical enterprises and gas pipelines (Gorlovka, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa), phosphate - to areas of agricultural production (Vinnitsa, Sumy, Odesa). Production of soda is concentrated in the areas of raw materials - salt (Donbass, Crimea).</p><p class="rvps2"> Focus on electricity, water and raw materials (gas, coal, oil) <em> chemistry organic synthesis </em> is represented by companies in Kharkiv, Berdyansk (plastic), Kiev, Odessa (chemical fiber), Dnepropetrovsk, White Church (rubber), varnishing and painting productions in Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Melitopol, Chernivtsi.</p><p class="rvps2"> <em> Pharmaceutical </em> <em> (medicine), </em> <em> Microbiology </em> (vitamins, Natural Food) gravitate to the industry and markets are located mainly in large cities (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Lubny). <em> </em></p><p class="rvps2"> chemical industry, like all farm state, requires significant resources for modernization. Particularly acute is the question of pollution industries. And in the case of complex problems related to improving productivity and competitiveness of products, the introduction of waste and low-waste technologies, chemical industry will become one of the most profitable components of the economy.</p>
