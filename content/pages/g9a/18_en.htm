<p class="rvps2"> One of the most developed heavy industry of Ukraine is <em> metallurgy </em>. Iron, steel, rolled, ferrous alloys, pipes - products industry. Presence in Ukraine large deposits of iron and manganese ore (under 5% and 20% of world reserves), coking coal, clay, fluxing materials caused the formation of strong metal base. Much of the material concentrated in the Dnipro and the Donbas, which together with the presence of customers (metalomistke engineering), developed transport network and resulted in significant human resources allocation in the near area businesses, Azov and Donetsk regions.</p><p class="rvps2"> main centers of the steel industry is Dnepropetrovsk, Krivoy Rog, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mariupol, Alchevsk, Khartsizk. As seen from the map <em> Metallurgy </em>, and the number of hosted enterprise and the share of the region in the production of industrial products dominate Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya region. Overall, the production of iron and manganese ores, iron and steel - Ukraine among world leaders. And exports of steel products for the state is one of the main sources of foreign currency earnings. The main problems the industry is pollution, the need for technical upgrading of production and quality metals.</p><p class="rvps2"> <em> another part of the field - </em> <em> nonferrous metallurgy </em> - compared with less developed black. Lack of raw materials, the need for considerable enrichment of raw energy - and vodomistkist production - the main characteristics of the industry. The leading component industry - Aluminium industry is represented Mykolayiv Alumina Plant (working on imported raw materials), Zaporozhye Aluminium Smelter and Sverdlovsk (Lugansk) factory aluminum alloys. Have a smaller volume of production of zinc, magnesium, titanium, ferro-nickel, mercury, gold. Enterprises located in a field near Donetsk regions and non-ferrous metallurgy. Perspective of the Carpathian region, where proved reserves of gold, aluminum and polymetallic ores. <em> </Em></p><p class="rvps2"></p>
