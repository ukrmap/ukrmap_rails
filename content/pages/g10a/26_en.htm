<p class="rvps2"> Engineering, together with energy and chemical industry is the so-called avant-garde three sectors, ensuring the development of scientific and technological progress. Modern machinery is composed of more than 200 industries. On the map, &quot;Machinery and metal&quot; represented by their individual groups. For example, heavy machinery produces manufacturing equipment industries: mining, energy and metallurgical industries. For heavy machinery are also machine tools and agricultural machinery. These industries are oriented primarily to the consumer and the areas of ferrous metallurgy.</p><p class="rvps2"> Automotive, railroad engineering, shipbuilding, aviation and rocket industry relates to transport engineering. Production of different vehicles are labor intensive, and therefore gravitate to big cities with the presence of skilled manpower.</p><p class="rvps2"> precision engineering combines science-and labor-intensive instrumentation, electrical and electronics industries. Leadership in production of precision engineering belongs to a highly developed countries, and in the manufacture of household appliances is dominated Newly industrialized Asian economies and China.</p><p class="rvps2"> high level of engineering and metalworking are the Group of Eight countries, Russia and most countries in Europe. Here are concentrated the most major centers of engineering. In a world of isolated core engineering areas:</p><p class="rvps2"></p><p class="rvps2"> North America (30% of world production);</p><p class="rvps2"></p><p class="rvps2"> Western Europe (30 %);</p><p class="rvps2"></p><p class="rvps2"> East and Southeast Asia (20 %);</p><p class="rvps2"></p><p class="rvps2"> Russia and other CIS countries.</p>
