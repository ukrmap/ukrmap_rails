<p class="rvps2"> Chemical industry, as one of the branches of the avant-garde trio, is developing rapidly. The twentieth century called the century of use of chemicals - so broad was the use of chemical materials and technologies in all spheres of economy and life. This production of cheap and various synthetic materials (plastics, photopolymers, chemical fiber, rubber, organic glass, photographic film), and production of basic chemicals (mineral fertilizers, acids, soda, detergents). Development of chemical industry opens up the possibility of creating new technologies for waste management in many industries.</p><p class="rvps2"> raw material base of industry wide and varied. In addition to mineral chemical raw area uses all kinds of fuel resources (especially oil and gas), wood, water, air, and industrial waste. The chemical industry is best represented in the developed world, where he formed the major areas of industry with a broad range of products. The European region produces up to 40% of the production industry. The leading countries are Germany (concern BASF - the largest producer of chemical products in the world), France, Britain, Italy, specializing in new high-tech products. The second region is North America&#39;s nearly as meaningfully Europe. U.S. is the world leader in the manufacture of polymeric materials and caustic soda. The third region is Eastern and South-East Asia, which is considered a powerful center of Japan. Powerful Japanese petrochemical works on imported oil. Rapidly developingtsya chemical industry in China (specializes in the manufacture of fertilizers and petrochemicals). Fourth region formed in Eastern Europe on the basis of rich natural resources and energy. High levels of the chemical industry is also characterized by Australia.</p><p class="rvps2"> Among developing countries, chemical industry is increasing, especially where there are significant reserves of oil and natural gas (Venezuela, Indonesia, Persian Gulf). In other countries, to extract some kinds of mining and chemical raw materials.</p>
