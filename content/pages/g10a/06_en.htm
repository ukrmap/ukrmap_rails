<p class="rvps2"> As can be seen on the map, the world&#39;s population is placed unevenly. Illustrates the population density - the ratio of population to a certain area of its area (people per sq. km.). In addition, the map shows major cities and agglomerations of the planet.</p><p class="rvps2"> on the globe, approximately 15% of the land is still not populated, about half of the cultivated areas have population density of less than 5 persons per sq. km. In addition, in some regions of Southeast Asia at one kilometer live 2,000 or more people.</p><p class="rvps2"> very uneven population density and individual continents. The lowest figure is Australia (less than 3 persons per sq. km.), The most densely populated Eurasia: on the one kilometer of its vast expanses of the average population of about 110 people. Among the most densely populated countries are Bangladesh (about 1100 persons per sq. km.), But in a country like Mongolia is home to fewer than 2 persons per sq. km. square.</p><p class="rvps2"> average density of the Earth in 1975 was 29 in 1987 - 38, 1994 - 40, and is now around 50 people. in sq. km.</p><p class="rvps2"> Placement of the population has always depended on natural factors (topography, climate). For example, 80% of humanity lives on the plains, occupying less than a third of the earth. Most comfortable for living and economic activities are moderate and subtropical climate zones, so they are all inhabited by people. The location of populations is also influenced by historical, socio-economic, demographic and other factors. So, for the most populated regions in the world belong to the territory of ancient agriculture (Great China Plain, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the valley of the Nile, Japanese Islands, about. Java), and old industrial areas of Europe and eastern North America. High population density of the coast of South America, Africa, Australia, which is associated with a history of development of these territories.<img align="right" border=0 alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="/images/g10a/06.files/img1.jpg">
</p><p class="rvps2"> Schedule &quot;Population Dynamics of the Earth in the past and forecast for the future&quot; is an illustration of the so-called population explosion - rapid population growth. Start boomers, as seen from the graph that accounts for the XVIII - XIX centuries. It is during the industrial revolution in Western Europe. In the twentieth century. after the collapse of colonial empires in 50-60 years. highest population growth rates were observed in developing countries, this trend continues today. According to UN projections to the end of the century the population of the planet may reach 10 billion people.</p>
