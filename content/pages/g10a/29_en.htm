<p class="rvps2"> Agriculture - the second (after the industry) in terms of manufactured products industry in the global economy. It plays a crucial role in the provision of food and raw materials in selected industries.</p><p class="rvps2"> Agriculture is comprehensive in nature. Use of land resources (farmland), as well as surface and underground water for irrigation and livestock water needs. Significant impact on the development of agriculture and its specialization are natural and climatic conditions (agro-climatic resources), topography and soil fertility.</p><p class="rvps2"> result of agricultural specialization is the concentration of agricultural enterprises of one branch in a certain area. Objective prerequisites for its formation are favorable natural conditions for development of certain branches of agriculture, the traditional working practices of the population of the area and the availability of food markets and raw materials. Specialization creates conditions for the intensification of agricultural production - improving productivity through the introduction of scientific and technological progress.</p><p class="rvps2"> In agriculture, identifies two main categories: crop production (farming) and animal husbandry. Other industries (fishing, apiculture, sericulture) play a much smaller role.</p><p class="rvps2"> leading sector in most developing countries is the crop. Only some of them are dominated by livestock farming. For example, in North Africa and Southwest Asia due to poor soil and arid climate plant growing almost not developed, and from the livestock industries dominated by sheep and camel.</p><p class="rvps2"> In highly developed countries is mainly livestock, which provides most of the agricultural products and provide the population of protein food (meat, milk, eggs).<img align="right" border=0 alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="/images/g10a/29.files/img1.png">
