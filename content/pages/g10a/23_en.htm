<p class="rvps2"> Electricity - industry, including manufacture of various types of power generation and transportation of its power lines to the consumer. Electricity development depends primarily on the level of economic development, energy availability, quality, location, method of extraction. Overall volume of production and consumption per capita are among the key indicators of economic development of any country. So 3 / 4 power of the world accounted for 10 countries: USA, Japan, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, France, UK, Ukraine and India.</p><p class="rvps2"> Most of the world&#39;s electricity is produced at thermal power plants (TPP), which use traditional fuels: coal, gas and fuel oil. Up to 20% of the world&#39;s hydroelectric power plants (HPP). In countries with well-to hydropower, the figure is much higher: Norway (99%), Brazil (92%), Austria, Canada, Peru, New Zealand - over 50%.</p><p class="rvps2"> Nuclear power plants (NPP) provides up to 10% of global electricity production. They use the energy of the decay of radioactive isotopes of uranium or plutonium. Nuclear reactors are nuclear power plants operating in 32 countries. Leading position in the electricity produced at nuclear power plants take in France (76%), Belgium (61%), Germany, Ukraine (up to 45 %).</p><p class="rvps2"> Only 1% of the world produce electricity plants using non-traditional (alternative) energy sources: solar, wind, tidal, wave energy, bioenergy, geothermal energy. Most of them geothermal power plants that use the internal heat of the Earth (bar chart, a comment submitted on a &quot;Fuel resources &quot;).</p>
