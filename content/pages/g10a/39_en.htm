<p class="rvps2"> Map of Education and Science provides insight into the spending on education in the countries of the world (as a percentage of GNP), as well as on the proportion of pupils and students in the population of individual countries. Is indicative of people with higher education (university) education. In industrialized countries the figure is an average of 19%, while in developing countries - 1%. In industrialized countries, a thousand residents have an average of 85 scientists and technicians in Sweden - 262, while in developing countries, only 9.</p><p class="rvps2"> high level of education of the population determines the potential of countries in the development of knowledge-intensive industries, which in turn determine the place of the state in the international division of labor. So, for example, Brazil, the rate of growth of number of students is one of the first among developing countries. Scientific and technical potential of the country is continuously increasing. Brazil now exports its technology overseas, provides technical and advisory services to many other countries.</p><p class="rvps2"> scale research and deployment of scientific and engineering institutions affect the territorial structure of the economy of countries and regions. Over the past decade, there was a network of cities for which research and design work are the main feature, the so-called science and technology and research parks, innovation centers, Technopolis. Science Parks - is posted on the university within the complex, with conditions for the development of research and development of advanced technologies, combined laboratory and research groups of universities and industrial companies specializing in high-tech industries. An example of science parks is technopolis Sophia in France, Oxford in the UK, Berkeley, Oakland in the U.S..</p><p class="rvps2"> Technopolis in many countries have become a kind of scientific growth poles, which form large regional innovation systems, for example, in Japan, Tsukuba district, Russia - Dubna, Silicon Valley in the U.S., Cambridge Science Park, around which there was most the UK&#39;s largest technopolis.</p>
