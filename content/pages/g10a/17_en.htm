<p class="rvps2"> Total water on Earth is over 1 387 million cu km. but of these only 2.5% is fresh water sushi (pie chart). Composition of freshwater world presented in a cylindrical diagram. Really usable for a small part of the waters of rivers and freshwater lakes. Much of the same volume of fresh water is in maloosvoennyh and inaccessible areas.</p><p class="rvps2"> Distribution of world&#39;s freshwater resources is uneven and depends on the geographical location of the territory and natural environment.</p><p class="rvps2"> world&#39;s fresh water can not be increased, however, water consumption is increasing, the water becomes contaminated and unfit for use. Therefore, the planet has a problem of shortage of fresh water. Water scarcity has a regional character. He was particularly felt areas with dry climates, where resourced full runoff per capita of less than 5 thousand cubic meters. per year. Agriculture in these areas is only possible on irrigated land.</p><p class="rvps2"> There are several ways to deal with water scarcity:</p><p class="rvps2"> - reducing water consumption in agriculture;</p><p class="rvps2">-introduction of industrial low-water and waterless technology, closed-water (wastewater reuse);</p><p class="rvps2"> - sea water desalination, water use icebergs;</p><p class="rvps2"> - construction of reservoirs, river flow.</p><p class="rvps2"> In a world built more than 60,000 reservoirs. The biggest of them are shown on the map.</p>
