<p class="rvps2"> This card can be used in characterizing the global challenges such as food, health problem, the problem of overcoming the backwardness of developing countries.</p><p class="rvps2"> medical (physiological) rate of caloric intake for human consumption per day is 2 300-2 600 calories and 70-100 grams of protein. If a person does not receive the minimum amount of calories, then he feels constant hunger and further physical and mental exhaustion. In the world according to WHO, 1.2 billion people go hungry. Another 2 billion people suffer from hidden hunger, getting malnutrition, which lacks a sufficient number of animal protein (meat, milk), essential vitamins and minerals. This phenomenon is especially common in countries where a diet dominated by residents of a food crop (eg rice, corn or potatoes). On the map it is clear that nutrition problems are citizens of developing countries. In developed countries, daily food consumption is an average of 3,300 calories and there is a surplus of food. The population of countries with low levels of economic development has opportunitiesTee to meet the need for good nutrition. With a threefold greater number of people, these states possess up to six times less than the total GDP than developed countries. Due to disease, starvation and malnutrition, lack of quality drinking water there is a low life expectancy and high mortality. Expenditure on health in developing countries are minimal, except for the NIS and the countries - exporters of petroleum.<img align="right" border=0 alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="/images/g10a/35.files/img1.png">

It provides a set of measures to introduce high-yielding varieties of cereals, breeding, irrigation, chemicalization and mechanization of agricultural production. The effectiveness of the Green Revolution has been proven in Asia (India, Thailand, Indonesia, China), as well as Mexico. These over-populated countries in recent decades have achieved impressive success in providing the population with food.</p>
