China collected a third of the global harvest of rice and millet crops. The country - one of the world&#39;s largest producers of corn, cotton, tea, soybean, tobacco, poultry, silk cocoons. The Chinese textile industry in terms of production of finished products zanimaet first place in the world. China came in second place in the world in steel production.
